<h2 class="main">Introduction</h2>
<h2 class="main">Jos&eacute; Rizal</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In that horrible drama, the Philippine revolution, one
man of the purest and noblest character stands out
pre-eminently&mdash;Jos&eacute; Rizal&mdash;poet, artist, philologue,
novelist, above all, patriot; his influence might have changed the
whole course of events in the islands, had not a blind and stupid
policy brought about the crime of his death.</p>
<p>This man, of almost pure Tagalo race, was born in 1861, at Calamba,
in the island of Luzon, on the southern shore of the Laguna de Bay,
where he grew up in his father&rsquo;s home, under the tutorage of a
wise and learned native priest, Leontio.</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s fine nature, expanding in the troublous latter
days of a long race bondage, was touched early with the fire of genuine
patriotism. He was eleven when the tragic consequences of the
Cavit&eacute; insurrection destroyed any lingering illusions of his
people, and stirred in them a spirit that has not yet been allayed.</p>
<p>The rising at Cavit&eacute;, like many others in the islands, was a
protest against the holding of benefices by friars&mdash;a thing
forbidden by a decree of the Council of Trent, but authorized in the
Philippines, by papal bulls, until such time as there should be a
sufficiency of native priests. This time never came. As the friars held
the best agricultural lands, and had a voice&mdash;and that the most
authoritative&mdash;in civil affairs, there developed in the rural
districts a veritable feudal system, bringing in its train the
arrogance and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e699" href="#xd21e699"
name="xd21e699">9</a>]</span>tyranny that like conditions develop. It
became impossible for the civil authorities to carry out measures in
opposition to the friars. &ldquo;The Government is an arm, the head is
the convent,&rdquo; says the old philosopher of Rizal&rsquo;s
story.</p>
<p>The rising at Cavit&eacute; miscarried, and vengeance fell. Dr.
Joseph Burgos, a saintly old priest, was put to death, and three other
native priests with him, while many prominent native families were
banished. Never had the better class of Filipinos been so outraged and
aroused, and from this time on their purpose was fixed, not to free
themselves from Spain, not to secede from the church they loved, but to
agitate ceaselessly for reforms which none of them longer believed
could be realized without the expulsion of the friars. In the school of
this purpose, and with the belief on the part of his father and Leontio
that he was destined to use his life and talents in its behalf,
Jos&eacute; was trained, until he left his home to study in Manila. At
the College of the Jesuits he carried off all the honors, with special
distinction in literary work. He wrote a number of odes; and a
melodrama in verse, the work of his thirteenth year, was successfully
played at Manila. But he had to wear his honors as an Indian among
white men, and they made life hard for him. He specially aroused the
dislike of his Spanish college mates by an ode in which he spoke of his
patria. A Tagalo had no native land, they contended&mdash;only a
country.</p>
<p>At twenty Rizal finished his course at Manila, and a few months
later went to Madrid, where he speedily won the degrees of Ph.D. and
M.D.; then to Germany&mdash;taking here another degree, doing his work
in the new language, which he mastered as he went along; to Austria,
where he gained great skill as an oculist; to France, Italy,
England&mdash;absorbing the languages and literature of these
countries, doing some fine sculpture by way of diversion. But in all
this he was single-minded; he never lost the voice of his call; he felt
more and more keenly the contrast between the hard lot of his country
and the freedom of these lands, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e705" href="#xd21e705" name="xd21e705">10</a>]</span>he bore it
ill that no one of them even knew about her, and the cancer eating away
her beauty and strength. At the end of this period of study he settled
in Berlin, and began his active work for his country.</p>
<p>Four years of the socialism and license of the universities had not
distorted Rizal&rsquo;s political vision; he remained, as he had grown
up, an opportunist. Not then, nor at any time, did he think his country
ready for self-government. He saw as her best present good her
continued union to Spain, &ldquo;through a stable policy based upon
justice and community of interests.&rdquo; He asked only for the
reforms promised again and again by the ministry, and as often
frustrated. To plead for the lifting of the hand of oppression from the
necks of his people, he now wrote his first novel, &ldquo;Noli Me
Tangere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next year he returned to the Philippines to find himself the
idol of the natives and a thorn in the flesh of friars and greedy
officials. The reading of his book was proscribed. He stayed long
enough to concern himself in a dispute of his townspeople with the
Dominicans over titles to lands; then finding his efforts vain and his
safety doubtful, he left for Japan. Here he pursued for some time his
usual studies; came thence to America, and then crossed to England,
where he made researches in the British Museum, and edited in Spanish,
&ldquo;Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas,&rdquo; by Dr. Antonio de Morga,
an important work, neglected by the Spaniards, but already edited in
English by Dean Stanley.</p>
<p>After publishing this work, in Paris, Rizal returned to Spain,
where, in 1890, he began a series of brilliant pleas for the
Philippines, in the <i>Solidaridad</i>, a liberal journal published at
Barcelona and afterward at Madrid. But he roused little sympathy or
interest in Spain, and his articles, repeated in pamphlets in the
Philippines, served to make his position more dangerous at home.</p>
<p>Disheartened but steadfast, he retired to Belgium, to write his
second novel, &ldquo;El Filibusterismo.&rdquo; &ldquo;Noli Me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e719" href="#xd21e719" name=
"xd21e719">11</a>]</span>Tangere&rdquo; is a poet&rsquo;s story of his
people&rsquo;s loves, faults, aspirations, and wrongs; &ldquo;El
Filibusterismo&rdquo; is the work of a student of statecraft, pointing
out the way to political justice and the development of national life.
Inspired, it would seem, by his own creation of a future for his
country, he returned to the <i>Solidaridad</i>, where, in a series of
remarkable articles, he forecast the ultimate downfall of Spain in the
Philippines and the rise of his people. This was his crime against the
Government: for the spirit which in a Spanish boy would not permit a
Tagalo to have a patria, in a Spaniard grown could not brook the
suggestion of colonial independence, even in the far future.</p>
<p>And now having poured out these passionate pleas and splendid
forecasts, Rizal was homesick for this land of his. He went to
Hong-Kong. Calamba was in revolt. His many friends at the English port
did everything to keep him; but the call was too persistent. December
23d, 1891, he wrote to Despujols, then governor-general of the
Philippines: &ldquo;If Your Excellency thinks my slight services could
be of use in pointing out the evils of my country and helping heal the
wounds reopened by the recent injustices, you need but to say so, and
trusting in your honor as a gentleman, I will immediately put myself at
your disposal. If you decline my offer, ... I shall at least be
conscious of having done all in my power, while seeking the good of my
country, to preserve her union to Spain through a stable policy based
upon justice and community of interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor expressed his gratitude, promised protection, and Rizal
sailed for Manila. But immediately after his landing he was arrested on
a charge of sedition, whose source made the governor&rsquo;s promise
impotent. Nothing could be proved against Rizal; but it was not the
purpose of his enemies to have him acquitted. A half-way sentence was
imposed, and he was banished to Dapidan, on the island of Mindanao.
Despujols was recalled to Spain.</p>
<p>In this exile Rizal spent four years, beloved by the natives,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e730" href="#xd21e730" name=
"xd21e730">12</a>]</span>teaching them agriculture, treating their sick
(the poor without charge), improving their schools, and visited from
time to time by patients from abroad, drawn here by his fame as an
oculist. Among these last came a Mr. Taufer, a resident of Hong-Kong,
and with him his foster-child, Josephine Bracken, the daughter of an
Irish sergeant. The pretty and adventurous girl and the banished
patriot fell in love with each other.</p>
<p>These may well have been among the happiest years of Rizal&rsquo;s
life. He had always been an exile in fact: now that he was one in name,
strangely enough he was able for the first time to live in peace among
his brothers under the skies he loved. He sang, in his pathetic
content:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Thou dear illusion with thy
soothing cup!</p>
<p class="line">I taste, and think I am a child again.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Oh! kindly tempest, favoring winds of heaven,</p>
<p class="line">That knew the hour to check my shifting flight,</p>
<p class="line">And beat me down upon my native soil,...&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Always about his philological studies, he began here a
work that should be of peculiar interest to us: a treatise on Tagalog
verbs, in the English language. Did his knowledge of America&rsquo;s
growing feeling toward Cuba lead him to foresee&mdash;as no one else
seems to have done&mdash;her appearance in the Philippines, or was he
thinking of England?</p>
<p>At Hong-Kong, and in his brief stays at Manila, Rizal had
established the Liga Filipina, a society of educated and progressive
islanders, whose ideas of needed reforms and methods of attaining them
were at one with his own. His banishment was a warning of danger and
checked the society&rsquo;s activity.</p>
<p>The Liga was succeeded, in the sense only of followed, by the
Katipunan,&mdash;a native word also meaning league. The makers of this
&ldquo;league,&rdquo; though avowing the same <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e753" href="#xd21e753" name=
"xd21e753">13</a>]</span>purpose as the members of the other, were men
of very different stamp. Their initiation was a blood-rite: they sought
immediate independence; they preached a campaign of force, if not of
violence. That a recent reviewer should have connected Dr.
Rizal&rsquo;s name with the Katipunan is difficult to understand. Not
alone are his writings, acts, and character against such a possibility,
but so also is the testimony of the Spanish archives: for not only was
it admitted at his final trial that he was not suspected of any
connection with the Katipunan, but his well-known disapproval of that
society&rsquo;s premature and violent action was even made a point
against him. He was so much the more dangerous to the state because he
had the sagacity to know that the times were not yet ripe for
independence, and the honesty and purity of purpose to make only
demands which the state herself well knew to be just.</p>
<p>When the rebellion of 1896 broke out, Rizal, still at Dapidan, knew
that his life would not long be worth a breath of his beloved
Philippine air. He asked, therefore, of the Government permission to go
to Cuba as an army surgeon. It was granted, and he was taken to
Manila&mdash;ovations all along his route&mdash;and embarked on the
<i>Isla de Panay</i> for Barcelona. He carried with him the following
letter from General Blanco, then governor-general of the Philippines,
to the Minister of War at Madrid:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Manila</span>, August 30th, 1896.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Esteemed General and Distinguished
Friend:</span></p>
<p>I recommend to you with genuine interest, Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal, who
is leaving for the Peninsula, to place himself at the disposal of the
Government as volunteer army surgeon to Cuba. During the four years of
his exile at Dapidan, he has conducted himself in the most exemplary
manner, and he is in my opinion the more worthy of pardon and
consideration, in that he is in no way connected with the extravagant
attempts we are now deploring, neither those of conspirators nor of the
secret societies that have been formed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e771" href="#xd21e771" name="xd21e771">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have the pleasure to reassure you of my high esteem, and
remain,</p>
<p>Your affectionate friend and comrade,</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ramon Blanco.</span></p>
</div>
<p>But as soon as the <i>Isla</i> was on the seas, despatches began to
pass between Manila and Madrid, and before she reached her port the
promises, acceptances, and recommendations of the Government officials
were void. Upon landing, Rizal was immediately arrested and confined in
the infamous Montjuich prison. Despujols was now military governor of
Barcelona. The interview of hours which he is said to have had with his
Filipino prisoner must have been dramatic. Rizal was at once
re-embarked, on the <i>Colon,</i> and returned to Manila, a state
prisoner. Blanco was recalled, and Poliavieja, a sworn friend of the
clericals, was sent out.</p>
<p>Rizal was tried by court-martial, on a charge of sedition and
rebellion. His guilt was manifestly impossible. Except as a prisoner of
the state, he had spent only a few weeks in the Philippines since his
boyhood. His life abroad had been perfectly open, as were all his
writings. The facts stated in General Blanco&rsquo;s letter to the
Minister of War were well known to all Rizal&rsquo;s accusers. The best
they could do was to aver that he had written &ldquo;depreciative
words&rdquo; against the Government and the Church. Some testimony was
given against him by men who, since the American occupation, have made
affidavit that it was false and forced from them by torture. Rizal made
a splendid defence, but he was condemned, and sentenced to the death of
a traitor. On that day Jos&eacute; Rizal y Mercado and Josephine
Bracken were married. Then the sweetness and strength of his character
and his singleness of purpose made a beautiful showing. In the night,
which his bride spent on her knees outside his prison, he wrote a long
poem of farewell to his patria adorado, fine in its abnegation and
exquisite in the wanderings of its fancy. He received the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e791" href="#xd21e791" name=
"xd21e791">15</a>]</span>ministrations of a Jesuit priest. He was
perfectly calm. &ldquo;What is death to me?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
have sown, others are left to reap.&rdquo; At dawn he was shot.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The poem in which he left a record of his last thoughts was the
following:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4>My Last Thought.</h4>

in his rising</p>

of his glory.</p>

<p class="first">The records of human suffering make known to us the
existence of ailments of such nature that the slightest touch irritates
and causes tormenting pains. Whenever, in the midst of modern
civilizations, I have tried to call up thy dear image, O my country!
either for the comradeship of remembrance or to compare thy life with
that about me, I have seen thy fair face disfigured and distorted by a
hideous social cancer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e915" href=

<p>Eager for thy health, which is our happiness, and seeking the best
remedy for thy pain, I am about to do with thee what the ancients did
with their sick: they exposed them on the steps of their temples, that
every one who came to adore the divinity within might offer a
remedy.</p>
<p>So I shall strive to describe faithfully thy state without
extenuation; to lift a corner of the covering that hides thy sore;
sacrificing everything to truth, even the love of thy glory, while

<h2 class="super">An Eagle Flight</h2>
<h2 class="label">I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The House on the Pasig.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was toward the end of October. Don Santiago de los
Santos, better known as Captain Tiago, was giving a dinner; and though,
contrary to custom, he had not announced it until that very afternoon,
it had become before evening the sole topic of conversation, not only
at Binondo, but in the other suburbs of Manila, and even in the city
itself. Captain Tiago passed for the most lavish of entertainers, and
it was well known that the doors of his home, like those of his
country, were closed to nobody and nothing save commerce and all new or
audacious ideas. The news spread, therefore, with lightning rapidity in
the world of the sycophants, the unemployed and idle, whom heaven has
multiplied so generously at Manila.</p>
<p>The dinner was given in a house of the Calle de Anloague, which may
yet be recognized, if an earthquake has not demolished it. This house,
rather large and of a style common to the country, stood near an arm of
the Pasig, called the Boco de Binondo, a rio which, like all others of
Manila, washing along the multiple output of baths, sewers, and fishing
grounds serves as a means of transport, and even furnishes
drinking-water, if such be the humor of the Chinese carrier. Scarcely
at intervals of a half-mile is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e937"
href="#xd21e937" name="xd21e937">19</a>]</span>this powerful artery of
the quarter where the traffic is most important, the movement most
active, dotted with bridges; and these, in ruins at one end six months
of the year and inapproachable the remaining six at the other, give
horses a pretext for plunging into the water, to the great surprise of
preoccupied mortals in carriages dozing tranquilly or philosophizing on
the progress of the century.</p>
<p>The house of Captain Tiago was rather low and on lines sufficiently
incorrect. A grand staircase with green balustrades, carpeted at
intervals, led from the vestibule, with its squares of colored faience,
to the main floor, between Chinese pedestals ornamented with fantastic
designs, supporting vases and jardini&egrave;res of flowers.</p>
<p>At the top of the staircase was a large apartment, called here
<i>caida</i>, which for this night served at once as dining- and
music-room. In the centre, a long table, luxuriously set, seemed to
promise to diners-out the most soothing satisfaction, at the same time
threatening the timid girl&mdash;the dalaga&mdash;who for six mortal
hours must submit to the companionship of strange and diverse
people.</p>
<p>In contrast to these mundane preparations, richly colored pictures
of religious subjects hung about the walls, and at the end of the
apartment, imprisoned in ornate and splendid Renaissance carving, was a
curious canvas of vast dimensions, bearing the inscription, &ldquo;Our
Lady of Peace and of Safe Journeys, Venerated at Antipolo.&rdquo; The
ceiling was prettily decorated with jewelled Chinese lamps, cages
without birds, spheres of crystal faced with colored foil, faded air
plants, <i>botetes</i>, etc. On the river side, through fantastic
arches, half Chinese, half European, were glimpses of a terrace, with
trellises and arbors, illuminated by little colored lanterns. Brilliant
chandeliers, reflected in great mirrors, lighted the apartment. On a
platform of pine was a superb grand piano. In a panel of the wall, a
large portrait in oil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e951" href=
"#xd21e951" name="xd21e951">20</a>]</span>represented a man of
agreeable face, in frock coat, robust, straight, symmetrical as the
gavel between his jewelled fingers.</p>
<p>The crowd of guests almost filled the room; the men separated from
the women, as in Catholic churches and synagogues. An old cousin of
Captain Tiago&rsquo;s was receiving alone. Her appearance was kindly,
but her tongue not very flexible to the Castilian. She filled her
r&ocirc;le by offering to the Spaniards trays of cigarettes and
<i>buyos</i>, and giving the Filipinos her hand to kiss. The poor old
lady, wearied at last, profited by the sound of breaking china to go
out hurriedly, grumbling at maladroits. She did not reappear.</p>
<p>Whether the pictures roused a spirit of devotion, whether the women
of the Philippines are exceptional, the feminine part of the assembly
remained silent. Scarcely was heard even a yawn, stifled behind a fan.
The men made more stir. The most interesting and animated group was
formed by two monks, two Spanish provincials, and an officer, seated
round a little table, on which were wine and English biscuits.</p>
<p>The officer, an old lieutenant, tall and morose, looked a Duke of
Alba, retired into the Municipal Guard. He spoke little and dryly. One
of the monks was a young Dominican, handsome, brilliant, precociously
grave; it was the curate of Binondo. Consummate dialectician, he could
escape from a <i>distinguo</i> like an eel from a fisherman&rsquo;s
nets. He spoke seldom, and seemed to weigh his words.</p>
<p>The other monk talked much and gestured more. Though his hair was
turning gray, he seemed to have preserved all his vigor. His carriage,
his glance, his large jaws, his herculean frame, gave him the air of a
Roman patrician in disguise. Yet he seemed genial, and if the timbre of
his voice was autocratic, his frank and merry laugh removed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e968" href="#xd21e968" name=
"xd21e968">21</a>]</span>any disagreeable impression, so far even that
one pardoned his appearing in the salon with unshod feet.</p>
<p>One of the provincials, a little man with a black beard, had nothing
remarkable about him but his nose, which, to judge from its size, ought
not to have belonged to him entire. The other, young and blond, seemed
newly arrived in the country. The Franciscan was conversing with him
somewhat warmly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;when you have been here several months; you will be convinced
that to legislate at Madrid and to execute in the Philippines is not
one and the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I, for example,&rdquo; continued
Brother D&aacute;maso, raising his voice to cut off the words of his
objector, &ldquo;I, who count twenty-three years of plane and palm, can
speak with authority. I spent twenty years in one pueblo. In twenty
years one gets acquainted with a town. San Diego had six thousand
souls. I knew each inhabitant as if I&rsquo;d borne and reared
him&mdash;with which foot this one limped, how that one&rsquo;s pot
boiled&mdash;and I tell you the reforms proposed by the Ministers are
absurd. The Indian is too indolent!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, pardon me,&rdquo; said the
young man, speaking low and drawing nearer; &ldquo;that word rouses all
my interest. Does it really exist from birth, this indolence of the
native, or is it, as some travellers say, only an excuse of our own for
the lack of advancement in our colonial policy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah! ask Se&ntilde;or Laruja, who
also knows the country well; ask him if the ignorance and idleness of
the Indians are not unparalleled?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In truth!&rdquo; the little dark
man made haste to affirm; &ldquo;nowhere will you find men more
careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nor more corrupt, nor more
ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nor more ill-bred.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e988" href="#xd21e988" name=
"xd21e988">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>The young man looked about uneasily. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said
he, still speaking low, &ldquo;it seems to me we are the guests of
Indians, and that these young ladies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah, you are too timid: Santiago
does not consider himself an Indian, besides, he isn&rsquo;t here.
These are the scruples of a newcomer. Wait a little. When you have
slept in our strapped beds, eaten the tinola, and seen our balls and
f&ecirc;tes, you&rsquo;ll change your tone. And more, you will find
that the country is going to ruin; she is ruined already!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What does your reverence
mean?&rdquo; cried the lieutenant and Dominican together.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The evil all comes from the fact
that the Government sustains wrong-doers in the face of the ministers
of God,&rdquo; continued the Franciscan, raising his voice and facing
about. &ldquo;When a curate rids his cemetery of a malefactor, no one,
not even the king, has the right to interfere; and a wretched general,
a petty general from nowhere&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father, His Excellency is
viceroy,&rdquo; said the officer, rising. &ldquo;His Excellency
represents His Majesty the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What Excellency?&rdquo; retorted
the Franciscan, rising in turn. &ldquo;Who is this king? For us there
is but one King, the legitimate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you do not retract that,
Father, I shall make it known to the governor-general,&rdquo; cried the
lieutenant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go to him now, go!&rdquo; retorted
Father D&aacute;maso; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll loan you my
carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dominican interposed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said he in
a tone of authority, &ldquo;you should not confuse things, nor seek
offence where there is none intended. We must distinguish in the words
of Father D&aacute;maso those of the man from those of the priest. The
latter per se can never offend, because they are infallible. In the
words of the man, a sub-distinction must be made, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1010" href="#xd21e1010" name=
"xd21e1010">23</a>]</span>into those said ab irato, those said ex ore,
but not in corde, and those said in corde. It is these last only that
can offend, and even then everything depends. If they were not
premeditated in mente, but simply arose per accidens in the heat of the
conversation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this interesting point there joined the group an old Spaniard,
gentle and inoffensive of aspect. He was lame, and leaned on the arm of
an old native woman, smothered in curls and frizzes, preposterously
powdered, and in European dress. With relief every one turned to salute
them. It was Doctor de Espada&ntilde;a and his wife, the Doctora
Do&ntilde;a Victorina. The atmosphere cleared.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Which, Se&ntilde;or Laruja, is the
master of the house?&rdquo; asked the young provincial. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t been presented.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They say he has gone
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No presentations are necessary
here,&rdquo; said Brother D&aacute;maso; &ldquo;Santiago is a good
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i lang="de">Er hat das <span class="corr" id="xd21e1024" title=
"Source: Pulfernicht">Pulfer nicht</span> erfunden</i>. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t invent gunpowder,&rdquo; added Laruja.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What, you too, Se&ntilde;or de
Laruja?&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Victorina over her fan. &ldquo;How
could the poor man have invented gunpowder when, if what they say is
true, the Chinese made it centuries ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Chinese? &rsquo;Twas a
Franciscan who invented it,&rdquo; said Brother D&aacute;maso.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A Franciscan, no doubt; he must
have been a missionary to China,&rdquo; said the Se&ntilde;ora, not
disposed to abandon her idea.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who is this with Santiago?&rdquo;
asked the lieutenant. Every one looked toward the door, where two men
had just entered. They came up to the group around the table.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One was the original of the portrait in oil, and he
led by the hand a young man in deep black. &ldquo;Good evening,
se&ntilde;ores; good evening, fathers,&rdquo; said Captain Tiago,
kissing the hands of the priests, &ldquo;I have the honor of presenting
to you Don <span class="corr" id="xd21e1046" title=
"Source: Crisostomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span> Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the name of Ibarra there were smothered exclamations. The
lieutenant, forgetting to salute the master of the house, surveyed the
young man from head to foot. Brother D&aacute;maso seemed petrified.
The arrival was evidently unexpected. Se&ntilde;or Ibarra exchanged the
usual phrases with members of the group. Nothing marked him from other
guests save his black attire. His fine height, his manner, his
movements, denoted sane and vigorous youth. His face, frank and
engaging, of a rich brown, and lightly furrowed&mdash;trace of Spanish
blood&mdash;was rosy from a sojourn in the north.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, surprised and
delighted, &ldquo;my father&rsquo;s old friend, Brother
D&aacute;maso!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes turned toward the Franciscan, who did not stir.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; said Ibarra,
puzzled. &ldquo;I am mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are not mistaken,&rdquo; said
the priest at last, in an odd voice; &ldquo;but your father was not my
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, astonished, drew slowly back the hand he had offered, and
turned to find himself facing the lieutenant, whose eyes had never left
him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Young man, are you the son of Don
Rafael Ibarra?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e1064" title=
"Source: Crisostomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span> bowed. <span class=

"xd21e1067">25</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then welcome to your country! I
knew your father well, one of the most honorable men of the
Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied
Ibarra, &ldquo;what you say dispels my doubts as to his fate, of which
as yet I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. He turned away to hide
them, and moved off into the crowd.</p>
<p>The master of the house had disappeared. Ibarra was left alone in
the middle of the room. No one presented him to the ladies. He
hesitated a moment, then went up to them and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Permit me to forget formalities,
and salute the first of my countrywomen I have seen for
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke, though many eyes regarded him with interest. Ibarra
turned away, and a jovial man, in native dress, with studs of
brilliants down his shirt-front, almost ran up to say:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, I wish to
know you. I am Captain Tinong, and live near you at Tondo. Will you
honor us at dinner to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ibarra,
pleased with the kindness, &ldquo;but to-morrow I must leave for San
Diego.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a pity! Well then, on your
return&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dinner is served,&rdquo; announced
a waiter of the Caf&eacute; La Campana.</p>
<p>The guests began to move toward the table, not without much ceremony
on the part of the ladies, especially the natives, who required a great
deal of polite urging. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1091" href=

<p class="first">The two monks finding themselves near the head of the
table, like two candidates for a vacant office, began politely
resigning in each other&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is your place, Brother
D&aacute;maso.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, yours, Brother
Sibyla.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are so much the older friend
of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you are the curate of the
quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This polite contention settled, the guests sat down, no one but
Ibarra seeming to think of the master of the house.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not to be with us, Don Santiago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no place: Lucullus was not dining with Lucullus.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble
yourself,&rdquo; said Captain Tiago, laying his hand on the young
man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;This feast is a thank-offering for your
safe return. Ho, there! bring the tinola! I&rsquo;ve ordered the tinola
expressly for you, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1115" title=

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When did you leave the

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then you must have almost
forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;On the contrary, it has been
always in my thoughts; but my country seems to have forgotten
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; asked
the old lieutenant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because for several months I have
had no news, so that I do not even know how and when my father

"xd21e1133">27</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And where were you that they
couldn&rsquo;t telegraph you?&rdquo; asked Do&ntilde;a Victorina.
&ldquo;When we were married, we sent despatches to the
peninsula.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, I was in the far
north,&rdquo; said Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have travelled much,&rdquo;
said the blond provincial; &ldquo;which of the European countries
pleased you most?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;After Spain, my second country,
the nations that are free.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what struck you as most
interesting, most surprising, in the general life of nations&mdash;the
genius of each, so to put it?&rdquo; asked Laruja.</p>
<p>Ibarra reflected.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Before visiting a country I
carefully studied its history, and, except the different motives for
national pride, there seems to me nothing surprisingly characteristic
in any nation. Given its history, everything appears natural; each
people&rsquo;s wealth and misery seem in direct proportion to its
freedom and its prejudices, and in consequence, in proportion to the
self-sacrifice or selfishness of its progenitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you discover nothing more
startling than that?&rdquo; demanded the Franciscan, with a mocking
laugh. &ldquo;It was hardly worth while squandering money for so slight
returns. Not a schoolboy but knows as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests eyed one another, fearful of what might follow. Ibarra,
astonished, remained silent a moment, then said quietly:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores, do not wonder at
these words of Brother D&aacute;maso. He was my curate when I was a
little boy, and with his reverence the years don&rsquo;t count. I thank
him for thus recalling the time when he was often an honored guest at
my father&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Sibyla furtively observed the Franciscan, who was trembling
slightly. At the first possible opportunity Ibarra rose. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1157" href="#xd21e1157" name=
"xd21e1157">28</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will pardon me if I excuse
myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I arrived only a few hours ago, and have
matters of importance to attend to. The dinner is over. I drink little
wine, and scarcely taste liquors.&rdquo; And raising a glass as yet
untouched, &ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Spain and the
Philippines forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going!&rdquo;
said Santiago in amazement. &ldquo;Maria Clara and her friends will be
with us in a moment. What shall I say to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That I was obliged to go,&rdquo;
said Ibarra, &ldquo;and that I&rsquo;m coming early in the
morning.&rdquo; And he went out.</p>
<p>The Franciscan unburdened himself.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You saw his arrogance,&rdquo; he
said to the blond provincial. &ldquo;These young fellows won&rsquo;t
take reproof from a priest. That comes of sending them to Europe. The
Government ought to prohibit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the young provincial added to his &ldquo;Colonial
Studies,&rdquo; this paragraph: &ldquo;In the Philippines, the least
important person at a feast is he who gives it. You begin by showing
your host to the door, and all goes merrily.... In the present state of
affairs, it would be almost a kindness to prohibit young Filipinos from
leaving their country, if not even from learning to read.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ibarra stood outside the house of Captain Tiago. The
night wind, which at this season brings a bit of freshness to Manila,
seemed to blow away the cloud that had darkened his face. Carriages
passed him like streaks of light, hired calashes rolled slowly by, and
foot-passengers of all nationalities jostled one another. With the
rambling gait of the preoccupied or the idle, he took his way toward
the Plaza de Binondo. Nothing was changed. It was the same street, with
the same blue and white houses, the same white walls with their
slate-colored fresco, poor imitations of granite. The church tower
showed the same clock with transparent face. The Chinese shop had the
same soiled curtains, the same iron triangles. One day, long ago,
imitating the street urchins of Manila, he had twisted one of these
triangles: nobody had ever straightened it. &ldquo;How little
progress!&rdquo; he murmured; and he followed the Calle de la
Sacristia, pursued by the cry of sherbet venders.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo; he thought;
&ldquo;one would say my voyage was a dream. Santo Dios! the street is
as bad as when I went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he contemplated this marvel of urban stability in an unstable
country, a hand fell lightly on his shoulder. He looked up and
recognized the old lieutenant. His face had put off its expression of
sternness, and he smiled kindly at <span class="corr" id="xd21e1183"
title="Source: Crisostomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1186" href="#xd21e1186" name=
"xd21e1186">30</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I was your father&rsquo;s friend: I wish you to consider me
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You seem to have known my father
well,&rdquo; said <span class="corr" id="xd21e1191" title=
"Source: Crisostomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span>; &ldquo;perhaps you can
tell me something of his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You do not know about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nothing at all, and Don Santiago
would not talk with me till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know, of course, where he
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Not even that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Guevara hesitated.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am an old soldier,&rdquo; he
said at last, in a voice full of compassion, &ldquo;and only know how
to say bluntly what I have to tell. Your father died in
prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra sprang back, his eyes fixed on the lieutenant&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Died in prison? Who died in
prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; said the
lieutenant, his voice still gentler.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My father&mdash;in prison? What
are you saying? Do you know who my father was?&rdquo; and he seized the
old man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m not mistaken:
Don Rafael Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, Don Rafael Ibarra,&rdquo;
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1219" title=
"Source: Crisostomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span> repeated
mechanically.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will soon learn that for an
honest man to keep out of prison is a difficult matter in the
Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You mock me! Why did he die in
prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come with me; we will talk on the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked along in silence, the officer stroking his beard in
search of inspiration.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As you know,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;your father was the richest man of the province, and if he had
many friends he had also enemies. We Spaniards who come to the
Philippines are seldom what we should be. I say this as truthfully of
some of your ancestors as of others. Most of us come to make a fortune
without regard to the means. Well, your <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1233" href="#xd21e1233" name="xd21e1233">31</a>]</span>father was
a man to make enemies among these adventurers, and he made enemies
among the monks. I never knew exactly the ground of the trouble with
Brother D&aacute;maso, but it came to a point where the priest almost
denounced him from the pulpit.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You remember the old
ex-artilleryman who collected taxes? He became the laughing-stock of
the pueblo, and grew brutal and churlish accordingly. One day he chased
some boys who were annoying him, and struck one down. Unfortunately
your father interfered. There was a struggle and the man fell. He died
within a few hours.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Naturally your father was
arrested, and then his enemies unmasked. He was called heretic,
filibustero, his papers were seized, everything was made to accuse him.
Any one else in his place would have been set at liberty, the
physicians finding that the man died of apoplexy; but your
father&rsquo;s fortune, his honesty, and his scorn of everything
illegal undid him. When his advocate, by the most brilliant pleading,
had exposed these calumnies, new accusations arose. He had taken lands
unjustly, owed men for imaginary wrongs, had relations with the
tulisanes, by which his plantations and herds were unmolested. The
affair became so complicated that no one could unravel it. Your father
gave way under the strain, and died suddenly&mdash;alone&mdash;in
prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the quarters.</p>
<p>The lieutenant hesitated. Ibarra said nothing, but grasped the old
man&rsquo;s long, thin hand; then turned away, caught sight of a coach,
and signalled the driver.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Fonda de Lala,&rdquo; he said, and
his words were scarcely audible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ibarra went up to his chamber, which faced the river,
threw himself down, and looked out through the open window. Across the
river a brilliantly lighted house was ringing with joyous music. Had
the young man been so minded, with the aid of a glass he might have
seen, in that radiant atmosphere, a vision. It was a young girl, of
exceeding beauty, wearing the picturesque costume of the Philippines. A
semicircle of courtiers was round her. Spaniards, Chinese, natives,
soldiers, curates, old and young, intoxicated with the light and music,
were talking, gesturing, disputing with animation. Even Brother Sibyla
deigned to address this queen, in whose splendid hair Do&ntilde;a
Victorina was wreathing a diadem of pearls and brilliants. She was
white, too white perhaps, and her deep eyes, often lowered, when she
raised them showed the purity of her soul. About her fair and rounded
neck, through the transparent tissue of the pi&ntilde;a, winked, as say
the Tagals, the joyous eyes of a necklace of brilliants. One man alone
seemed unreached by all this light and loveliness; it was a young
Franciscan, slim, gaunt, pale, who watched all from a distance, still
as a statue.</p>
<p>But Ibarra sees none of this. Another spectacle appears to his
fancy, commands his eyes. Four walls, bare and dank, enclose a narrow
cell, lighted by a single streak of day. On the moist and noisome floor
is a mat; on the mat an old man dying. Beaten down by fever, he lies
and looks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1255" href="#xd21e1255"
name="xd21e1255">33</a>]</span>about him, calling a name, in strangling
voice, with tears. No one&mdash;a clanking chain, an echoed groan
somewhere; that was all. And away off in the bright world, laughing,
singing, drenching flowers with wine, a young man.... One by one the
lights go out in the festal house: no more of noise, or song, or harp;
but in Ibarra&rsquo;s ears always the agonizing cry.</p>
<p>Silence has drawn her deep breath over Manila; all its life seems
gone out, save that a cock&rsquo;s crow alternates with the bells of
clock towers and the melancholy watch-cry of the guard. A quarter moon
comes up, flooding with its pale light the universal sleep. Even
Ibarra, wearied more perhaps with his sad thoughts than his long
voyage, sleeps too. Only the young Franciscan, silent and motionless
just now at the feast, awake still. His elbow on the window-place of
his little cell, his chin sunk in his palm, he watches a glittering
star. The star pales, goes out, the slender moon loses her gentle
light, but the monk stays on; motionless, he looks toward the horizon,
lost now behind the morning mists, over the field of Bagumbayan, over
the sleeping sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1259" href=

<h2 class="label">VI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Captain Tiago and Maria.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While our friends are still asleep or breakfasting, we
will sketch the portrait of Captain Tiago. We have no reason to ignore
him, never having been among his guests. Short, less dark than most of
his compatriots, of full face and slightly corpulent, Captain Tiago
seemed younger than his age. His rounded cranium, very small and
elongated behind, was covered with hair black as ebony. His eyes, small
and straight set, kept always the same expression. His nose was
straight and finely cut, and if his mouth had not been deformed by the
use of tobacco and buyo, he had not been wrong in thinking himself a
handsome man.</p>
<p>He was reputed the richest resident of Binondo, and had large
estates in La Pampanga, on the Laguna de Bay, and at San Diego. From
its baths, its famous gallera, and his recollections of the place, San
Diego was his favorite pueblo, and here he passed two months every
year. He had also properties at Santo Cristo, in the Calle de Anloague,
and in the Calle Rosario; the exploitation of the opium traffic was
shared between him and a Chinese, and, needless to say, brought him
great gains. He was purveyor to the prisoners at Bilibid, and furnished
zacate to many Manila houses. On good terms with all authority, shrewd,
pliant, daring in speculation, he was the sole rival of a certain Perez
in the awards of divers contracts which the Philippine Government
always places in privileged hands. From all of which it resulted that
Captain Tiago was as happy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1269"
href="#xd21e1269" name="xd21e1269">35</a>]</span>as can be a man whose
small head announces his native origin. He was rich, and at peace with
God, with the Government, and with men.</p>
<p>That he was at peace with God could not be doubted. One has no
motive for being at enmity with Him when one is well in the land, and
has never had to ask Him for anything. From the grand salon of the
Manila home, a little door, hid behind a silken curtain, led to a
chapel&mdash;something obligatory in a Filipino house. There were
Santiago&rsquo;s Lares, and if we use this word, it is because the
master of the house was rather a poly- than a monotheist. Here, in
sculpture and oils, were saints, martyrdoms, and miracles; a chapter
could scarcely enumerate them all. Before these images Santiago burned
his candles and made his requests known.</p>
<p>That he was at peace with the Government, however difficult the
problem, could not be doubted either. Incapable of a new idea, and
contented with his lot, he was disposed to obey even to the lowest
functionary, and to offer him capons, hams, and Chinese fruits at all
seasons. If he heard the natives maligned, not considering himself one,
he chimed in and said worse: one criticised the Chinese merchants or
the Spaniards, he, who thought himself pure Iberian, did it too. He was
for two years gobernadorcillo of the rich association of half-breeds,
in the face of protestations from many who considered him a native. The
impious called him fool; the poor, pitiless and cruel; his inferiors, a
tyrant.</p>
<p>As to his past, he was the only son of a rich sugar merchant, who
died when Santiago was still at school. He had then to quit his studies
and give himself to business. He married a young girl of Santa Cruz,
who brought him social rank and helped his fortunes.</p>
<p>The absence of an heir in the first six years of marriage
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1279" href="#xd21e1279" name=
"xd21e1279">36</a>]</span>made Captain Tiago&rsquo;s thirst for riches
almost blameworthy. In vain all this time did Do&ntilde;a Pia make
novenas and pilgrimages and scatter alms. But at length she was to
become a mother. Alas! like Shakespeare&rsquo;s fisherman who lost his
songs when he found a treasure, she never smiled again, and died,
leaving a beautiful baby girl, whom Brother D&aacute;maso presented at
the font. The child was called Maria Clara.</p>
<p>Maria Clara grew, thanks to the care of good Aunt Isabel. Her eyes,
like her mother&rsquo;s, were large, black, and shaded by long lashes;
sparkling and mirthful when she laughed; when she did not, thoughtful
and profound, even sad. Her curly hair was almost blond, her nose
perfect; and her mouth, small and sweet like her mother&rsquo;s, was
flanked by charming dimples. The little thing, idol of every one, lived
amid smiles and love. The monks f&ecirc;ted her. They dressed her in
white for their processions, mingled jasmine and lilies in her hair,
gave her little silver wings, and in her hands blue ribbons, the reins
of fluttering white doves. She was so joyous, had such a candid baby
speech, that Captain Tiago, enraptured with her, passed his time in
blessing the saints.</p>
<p>In the lands of the sun, at thirteen or fourteen, the child becomes
a woman. At this age full of mysteries, Maria Clara entered the convent
of Santa Catalina, to remain several years. With tears she parted from
the sole companion of her childish games, <span class="corr" id=

who in turn was soon to leave his home. Some years after his departure,
Don Rafael and Captain Tiago, knowing the inclinations of their
children, agreed upon their marriage. This arrangement was received
with eager joy by two hearts beating at two extremities of the world.

together for the first time since his return. They began with charming
futilities, so sweet to those who understand, so meaningless to others.
She is sister to Cain, a little jealous; she says to her lover:
&ldquo;Did you never forget me among the many beautiful women you have
seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He too, he is brother to Cain, a bit subtle.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Could I ever forget you!&rdquo; he
answered, gazing into the dark eyes. &ldquo;Your remembrance made
powerless that lotus flower, Europe, which steeps out of the memory of
many of my countrymen the hopes and wrongs of our land. It seemed as if
the spirit, the poetic incarnation of my country was you, frank and
lovely daughter of the Philippines! My love for you and that for her
fused in one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I know only your pueblo, Manila
and Antipolo,&rdquo; replied the young girl, radiant; &ldquo;but I have
always thought of you, and though my confessor commanded it, I was
never able to forget you. I used to think over all our childish plays
and quarrels. Do you remember the day you were really angry? Your
mother had taken us to wade in the brook, behind the reeds. You put a
crown of orange flowers on my head and called me Chloe. But your mother
took the flowers and ground them with a stone, to mix with <i>gogo</i>,
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1308" href="#xd21e1308" name=
"xd21e1308">38</a>]</span>washing our hair. You cried.
&lsquo;Stupid,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you shall see how good your hair
smells!&rsquo; I laughed; at that you were angry and wouldn&rsquo;t
speak to me, while I wanted to cry. On the way home, when the sun was
very hot, I picked some sage leaves for your head. You smiled your
thanks, and we were friends again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra opened his pocketbook and took out a paper in which were some
leaves, blackened and dry, but fragrant still.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your sage leaves,&rdquo; he
replied to her questioning look.</p>
<p>In her turn, she drew out a little white satin purse.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hands off!&rdquo; as he reached
out for it, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a letter in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My letter of good-by?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you written me any others,
se&ntilde;or mio?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Lots of fibs, excuses of a bad
debtor,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re good I will read it
to you, suppressing the gallantries, though, so you won&rsquo;t suffer
too much.&rdquo; And lifting the paper to hide her face, she began:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-large">&ldquo;&lsquo;My&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll not read what follows, because it&rsquo;s a fib&rdquo;; and
she ran her eyes over several lines. &ldquo;In spite of my prayers, I
must go. &lsquo;You are no longer a boy,&rsquo; my father said,
&lsquo;you must think of the future. You have to learn things your own
country cannot teach you, if you would be useful to her some day. What,
almost a man and I see you in tears?&rsquo; Upon that I confessed my
love for you. He was silent, then placing his hand on my shoulder he
said in a voice full of emotion: &lsquo;Do you think you alone know how
to love; that it costs your father nothing to let you go away from him?
It is not long since we lost your mother, and I am growing old, yet I
accept my solitude and run the risk of never seeing you again. For you
the future opens, for me it shuts; the fire of youth is yours, frost
touches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1329" href="#xd21e1329"
name="xd21e1329">39</a>]</span>me, and it is you who weep, you who do
not know how to sacrifice the present to a to-morrow good for you and
for your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra&rsquo;s agitation stopped the reading; he had become very
pale and was walking back and forth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is it? You are ill!&rdquo;
cried Maria, going toward him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;With you I have forgotten my duty;
I should be on my way to the pueblo. To-morrow is the Feast of the
Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria was silent. She fixed on him her great, thoughtful eyes, then
turned to pick some flowers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said, and her voice
was deep and sweet; &ldquo;I keep you no longer. In a few days we shall
see each other again. Put these flowers on your father&rsquo;s
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later, Captain Tiago found Maria in the chapel, at the foot
of a statue of the Virgin, weeping. &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said he,
to console her; &ldquo;burn some candles to St. Roch and St. Michael,
patrons of travellers, for the tulisanes are numerous: better spend
four r&eacute;ales for wax than pay a ransom.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">Reminiscences.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ibarra&rsquo;s carriage was crossing one of the most
animated quarters of Manila. The street life that had saddened him the
night before, now, in spite of his sorrow, made him smile. Everything
awakened a world of sleeping recollections.</p>
<p>These streets were not yet paved, so if the sun shone two days
continuously, they turned to powder which covered everything. But let
it rain a day, you had a mire, reflecting at night the shifting lamps
of the carriages and bespattering the foot-passengers on the narrow
walks. How many women had lost their embroidered slippers in these
muddy waves!</p>
<p>The good and honorable pontoon bridge, so characteristically
Filipino, doing its best to be useful in spite of natural faults, and
rising or falling with the caprices of the Pasig,&mdash;that brave
bridge was no more. The new Spanish bridge drew Ibarra&rsquo;s
attention. Carriages passed continuously, drawn by groups of dwarf
horses, in splendid harness. In these sat at ease government clerks
going to their bureaus, officers, Chinese, self-satisfied and
ridiculously grave monks, canons. In an elegant victoria, Ibarra
thought he recognized Father D&aacute;maso, deep in thought. From an
open carriage, where his wife and two daughters accompanied him,
Captain Tinong waved a friendly greeting.</p>
<p>Then came the Botanical Gardens, then old Manila, still enclosed in
its ditches and walls; beyond that the sea; beyond <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1357" href="#xd21e1357" name=
"xd21e1357">41</a>]</span>that, Europe, thought Ibarra. But the little
hill of Bagumbayan drove away all fancies. He remembered the man who
had opened the eyes of his intelligence, taught him to find out the
true and the just. It was an old priest, and the holy man had died
there, on that field of execution!</p>
<p>To these thoughts he replied by murmuring: &ldquo;No, after all,
first the country, first the Philippines, daughters of Spain, first the
Spanish home-land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His carriage rolled on. It passed a cart drawn by two horses whose
hempen harness told of the back country. Sometimes there sounded the
slow and heavy tread of a pensive carabao, drawing a great tumbrel; its
conductor, on his buffalo skin, accompanying, with a monotonous and
melancholy chant, the strident creaking of the wheels. Sometimes there
was the dull sound of a native sledge&rsquo;s worn runners. In the
fields grazed the herds, and among them white herons gravely
promenaded, or sat tranquil on the backs of sleepy oxen beatifically
chewing their cuds of prairie grass. Let us leave the young man, wholly
occupied now with his thoughts. The sun which makes the tree-tops burn,

their thick shoes; the sun which halts the countrywoman under a clump
of great reeds, and makes her think of things vague and
strange&mdash;that sun has no enchantment for him.</p>

<p class="first">Ibarra had not been mistaken. It was indeed Father
D&aacute;maso he had seen, on his way to the house which he himself had
just left.</p>
<p>Maria Clara and Aunt Isabel were entering their carriage when the
monk arrived. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked, and in his
preoccupation he gently tapped the young girl&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To the convent to get my
things,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! ah! well, well! we shall see
who is the stronger, we shall see!&rdquo; he murmured, as he left the
two women somewhat surprised and went up the steps.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably committing his
sermon,&rdquo; said Aunt Isabel. &ldquo;Come, we are late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot say whether Father D&aacute;maso was committing a sermon,
but he must have been absorbed in important things, for he did not
offer his hand to Captain Tiago.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Santiago,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;we must have a serious talk. Come into your office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tiago felt uneasy. He answered nothing, but followed the
gigantic priest, who closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>While they talk, let us see what has become of Father Sibyla.</p>
<p>The learned Dominican, his mass once said, had set out for the
convent of his order, which stands at the entrance <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1392" href="#xd21e1392" name=
"xd21e1392">43</a>]</span>to the city, near the gate bearing
alternately, according to the family reigning at Madrid, the name of
Magellan or Isabella II.</p>
<p>Brother Sibyla entered, crossed several halls, and knocked at a
door.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said a faint
voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God give health to your
reverence,&rdquo; said the young Dominican, entering. Seated in a great
armchair was an old priest, meagre, jaundiced, like Rivera&rsquo;s
saints. His eyes, deep-sunken in their orbits, were arched with heavy
brows, intensifying the flashes of their dying light.</p>
<p>Brother Sibyla was moved. He inclined his head, and seemed to
wait.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; gasped the sick man,
&ldquo;they recommend an operation! An operation at my age! Oh, this
country, this terrible country! You see what it does for all of us,
Hernando!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what has your reverence
decided?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To die! Could I do otherwise? I
suffer too much, but&mdash;I&rsquo;ve made others suffer. I&rsquo;m
paying my debt. And you? How are you? What do you bring me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I came to talk of the mission you
gave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! and what is there to
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve told us fairy
tales,&rdquo; answered Brother Sibyla wearily. &ldquo;Young Ibarra
seems a sensible fellow. He is not stupid at all, and thoroughly
manly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it so!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hostilities began
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! and how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Sibyla briefly recounted what had passed between Brother
D&aacute;maso and <span class="corr" id="xd21e1423" title=
"Source: Crisostomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span>.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said in
conclusion, &ldquo;the young man is going to marry the daughter of
Captain Tiago, who was educated at the convent of our sisters. He is
rich; he would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1428" href=
"#xd21e1428" name="xd21e1428">44</a>]</span>not go about making himself
enemies and compromise at once his happiness and his
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man moved his hand in sign of assent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, you are right. He should be
ours, body and soul. But if he declare himself our enemy, so much the
better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Sibyla looked at the old man in surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For the good of our sacred order,
you understand,&rdquo; he added, breathing with difficulty; &ldquo;I
prefer attack to the flatteries and adulations of friends; besides,
those are bought.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your reverence believes
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him sadly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Remember this well,&rdquo; he went
on, catching his breath; &ldquo;our power lasts as long as it&rsquo;s
believed in. If we&rsquo;re attacked, the Government reasons:
&lsquo;They are assailed because in them is seen an obstacle to
liberty: therefore we must support them!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But if the Government should
listen to our enemies, if it should come to covet what we have
amassed&mdash;if there should be a man hardy
enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! then beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were silent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And too,&rdquo; the sick man
continued, &ldquo;we have need of attack to show us our faults and make
us better them. Too much flattery deceives us; we sleep; and more, it
makes us ridiculous, and the day we become ridiculous we fall as we
have fallen in Europe. Money will no longer come to our churches. No
one will buy scapulary, penitential cords, anything; and when we cease
to be rich, we can no longer convince the conscience. And the worst is,
that we&rsquo;re working our own destruction. For one thing, this
immoderate thirst for gain, which I&rsquo;ve combated in vain in all
our chapters, this thirst will be our ruin. I fear we are already
declining. God blinds whom He will destroy.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1453" href="#xd21e1453" name=
"xd21e1453">45</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall always have our
lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But every year we raise their
price, and force the Indian to buy of others. The people are beginning
to murmur. We ought not to increase the burdens we&rsquo;ve already
laid on their shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So your reverence believes that
the revenues&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Talk no more of money,&rdquo;
interrupted the old man with aversion. &ldquo;You say the lieutenant
threatened Father D&aacute;maso?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, Father,&rdquo; replied
Sibyla, half smiling; &ldquo;but this morning he told me the sherry had
mounted to his head, and he thought it must have been the same with
Brother D&aacute;maso. &lsquo;And your threat?&rsquo; I asked
jestingly. &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I know how to keep my
word when it doesn&rsquo;t smirch my honor; I was never an
informer&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why I am only a
lieutenant.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Though the lieutenant had not carried out his threat to go to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1468" title=
"Source: Malacanan">Malaca&ntilde;ang</span>, the captain-general none
the less knew what had happened. A young officer told the story.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;From whom do you have it?&rdquo;
demanded His Excellency, smiling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;From De Laruja.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain-general smiled again, and added:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s tongue, monk&rsquo;s
tongue doesn&rsquo;t wound. I don&rsquo;t wish to get entangled with
these men in skirts. Besides, the provincial made light of my orders;
to punish this priest I demanded that his parish be changed. Well, they
gave him a better. Monkishness! as we say in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone, His Excellency ceased to smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh! if the people were not so
dense, how easy to bridle their reverences! But every nation merits its
lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Captain Tiago finished his conference with Father
D&aacute;maso. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1486" href=
"#xd21e1486" name="xd21e1486">46</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And now you are warned,&rdquo;
said the Franciscan upon leaving. &ldquo;This would have been avoided
if you hadn&rsquo;t equivocated when I asked you how the matter stood.
Don&rsquo;t make any more false moves, and trust her
godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tiago took two or three turns about the room, reflecting and
sighing. Then suddenly, as if a happy thought had struck him, running
to the oratory, he extinguished the two candles lighted for the
safeguard of Ibarra. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1491" href=

<h2 class="main">The Pueblo.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Almost on the banks of the lake, in the midst of
meadows and streams, is the pueblo of San Diego. It exports sugar,
rice, coffee, and fruits, or sells these articles of merchandise at low
prices to Chinese traders.</p>
<p>When, on a clear day, the children climb to the top stage of the
moss-grown and vine-clad church tower, there are joyous exclamations.
Each picks out his own little roof of <i>nipa</i>, tile, zinc, or palm.
Beyond they see the rio, a monstrous crystal serpent asleep on a carpet
of green. Trunks of palm trees, dipping and swaying, join the two
banks, and if, as bridges, they leave much to be desired for trembling
old men and poor women who must cross with heavy baskets on their
heads, on the other hand they make fine gymnastic apparatus for the
young.</p>
<p>But what besides the rio the children never fail to talk about is a
certain wooded peninsula in this sea of cultivated land. Its ancient
trees never die, unless the lightning strikes their high tops. Dust
gathers layer on layer in their hollow trunks, the rain makes soil of
it, the birds bring seeds, a tropical vegetation grows there in wild
freedom: bushes, briers, curtains of netted bind-weed, spring from the
roots, reach from tree to tree, hang swaying from the branches, and
Flora, as if yet unsatisfied, sows on the trees themselves; mosses and
fungi live on the creased bark, and graceful aerial guests pierce with
their tendrils the hospitable branches. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1506" href="#xd21e1506" name="xd21e1506">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>This wood is the subject of a legend.</p>
<p>When the pueblo was but a group of poor cabins, there arrived one
day a strange old Spaniard with marvellous eyes, who scarcely spoke the
Tagal. He wished to buy lands having thermal springs, and did so,
paying in money, dress, and jewelry. Suddenly he disappeared, leaving
no trace. The people of the pueblo had begun to think of him as a
magician, when one day his body was found hanging high to the branch of
a giant fig tree. After it had been buried at the foot of the tree, no
one cared much to venture in that quarter.</p>
<p>A few months later there arrived a young Spanish halfbreed, who
claimed to be the old man&rsquo;s son. He settled, and gave himself to
agriculture. Don Saturnino was taciturn and of violent temper, but very
industrious. Late in life he married a woman of Manila, who bore him
Don Rafael, the father of <span class="corr" id="xd21e1513" title=
"Source: Crisostomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span>.</p>
<p>Don Rafael, from his youth, was much beloved. He rapidly developed
his father&rsquo;s lands, the population multiplied, the Chinese came,
the hamlet grew to a pueblo, the native curate died and was replaced by
Father D&aacute;maso. And all this time the people respected the
sepulchre of the old Spaniard, and held it in superstitious awe.
Sometimes, armed with sticks and stones, the children dared run near it
to gather wild fruits; but while they were busy at this, or stood
gazing at the bit of rope still dangling from the limb, a stone or two
would fall from no one knew where. Then with cries of &ldquo;The old
man! the old man!&rdquo; they threw down sticks and fruit, ran in all
directions, between the rocks and bushes, and did not stop till they
were out of the woods, all pale and breathless, some crying, few daring
to laugh. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1518" href="#xd21e1518"

<h2 class="label">XI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Sovereigns.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Who was the ruler of the pueblo? Not Don Rafael during
his lifetime, though he possessed the most land, and nearly every one
owed him. As he was modest, and gave little value to his deeds, no
party formed around him, and we have seen how he was deserted and
attacked when his fortunes fell.</p>
<p>Was it Captain Tiago? It is true his arrival was always heralded
with music, he was given banquets by his debtors, and loaded with
presents; but he was laughed at in secret, and called Sacristan
Tiago.</p>
<p>Was it by chance the town mayor, the gobernadorcillo? Alas! he was
an unfortunate, who governed not, but obeyed; did not dispose, but was
disposed of. And yet he had to answer to the alcalde for all these
dispositions, as if they emanated from his own brain. Be it said in his
favor that he had neither stolen nor usurped his honors, but that they
cost him five thousand pesos and much humiliation.</p>
<p>Perhaps then it was God? But to most of these good people, God
seemed one of those poor kings surrounded by favorites to whom their
subjects always take their supplications, never to them.</p>
<p>No, San Diego was a sort of modern Rome. The curate was the pope at
the Vatican; the alf&eacute;rez of the civil guard, the King in the
Quirinal. Here as there, difficulties arose from the situation.</p>
<p>The present curate, Brother Bernardo Salvi, was the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1536" href="#xd21e1536" name=
"xd21e1536">50</a>]</span>young and silent Franciscan we have already
seen. In mode of life and in appearance he was very unlike his
predecessor, Brother D&aacute;maso. He seemed ill, was always
thoughtful, accomplished strictly his religious duties, and was careful
of his reputation. Through his zeal, almost all his parishioners had
speedily become members of the Third Order of St. Francis, to the great
dismay of the rival order, that of the Holy Rosary. Four or five
scapularies were suspended around every neck, knotted cords encircled
all the waists, and the innumerable processions of the order were a joy
to see. The head sacristan took in a small fortune, selling&mdash;or
giving as alms, to put it more correctly&mdash;all the paraphernalia
necessary to save the soul and combat the devil. It is well known that
this evil spirit, who once dared attack God face to face, and accuse
His divine word, as the book of Job tells us, is now so cowardly and
feeble that he flees at sight of a bit of painted cloth, and fears a
knotted cord.</p>
<p>Brother Salvi again greatly differed from Brother
D&aacute;maso&mdash;who set everything right with fists or ferrule,
believing it the only way to reach the Indian&mdash;in that he punished
with fines the faults of his subordinates, rarely striking them.</p>
<p>From his struggles with the curate, the alf&eacute;rez had a bad
reputation among the devout, which he deserved, and shared with his
wife, a hideous and vile old Filipino woman named Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion. The husband avenged his conjugal woes on himself by
drinking like a fish; on his subordinates, by making them exercise in
the sun; and most frequently on his wife, by kicks and drubbings. The
two fought famously between themselves, but were of one mind when it
was a question of the curate. Inspired by his wife, the officer ordered
that no one be abroad in the streets after nine at night. The priest,
who did not like this restriction, retorted in lengthy sermons,
whenever the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1542" href="#xd21e1542"
name="xd21e1542">51</a>]</span>alf&eacute;rez went to church. Like all
impenitents, the alf&eacute;rez did not mend his ways for that, but
went out swearing under his breath, arrested the first sacristan he
met, and made him clean the yard of the barracks. So the war went on.
All this, however, did not prevent the alf&eacute;rez and the curate
chatting courteously enough when they met.</p>
<p>And they were the rulers of the pueblo of San Diego. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The cemetery of San Diego is in the midst of
rice-fields. It is approached by a narrow path, powdery on sunny days,
navigable on rainy. A wooden gate and a wall half stone, half bamboo
stalks, succeed in keeping out men, but not the curate&rsquo;s goats,
nor the pigs of his neighbors. In the middle of the enclosure is a
stone pedestal supporting a great wooden cross. Storms have bent the
strip of tin on which were the I. N. R. I., and the rain has washed off
the letters. At the foot of the cross is a confused heap of bones and
skulls thrown out by the grave-digger. Everywhere grow in all their
vigor the bitter-sweet and rose-bay. Some tiny flowerets, too, tint the
ground&mdash;blossoms which, like the mounded bones, are known to their
Creator only. They are like little pale smiles, and their odor scents
of the tomb. Grass and climbing plants fill the corners, cover the
walls, adorning this otherwise bare ugliness; they even penetrate the
tombs, through earthquake fissures, and fill their yawning gaps.</p>
<p>At this hour two men are digging near the crumbling wall. One, the
grave-digger, works with the utmost indifference, throwing aside a
skull as a gardener would a stone. The other is preoccupied; he
perspires, he breathes hard.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he says at length in
Tagalo. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better dig in some other place? This
grave is too recent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All the graves are the same, one
is as recent as another.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1561" href="#xd21e1561" name="xd21e1561">53</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t endure
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a woman! You should go and be
a clerk! If you had dug up, as I did, a boy of twenty days, at night,
in the rain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Uh-h-h! And why did you do
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave-digger seemed surprised.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why? How do I know, I was ordered
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who ordered you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this question the grave-digger straightened himself, and examined
the rash young man from head to foot.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come! come! You&rsquo;re curious
as a Spaniard. A Spaniard asked me the same question, but in secret.
I&rsquo;m going to say to you what I said to him: the curate ordered
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh! and what did you do with the
body?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The devil! if I didn&rsquo;t know
you, I should take you for the police. The curate told me to bury it in
the Chinese cemetery, but it&rsquo;s a long way there, and the body was
heavy. &lsquo;Better be drowned,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;than
lie with the Chinese,&rsquo; and I threw it into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, no, stop digging!&rdquo;
interrupted the younger man, with a cry of horror, and throwing down
his spade he sprang out of the grave.</p>
<p>The grave-digger watched him run off signing himself, laughed, and
went to work again.</p>
<p>The cemetery began to fill with men and women in mourning. Some of
them came for a moment to the open grave, discussed some matter, seemed
not to be agreed, and separated, kneeling here and there. Others were
lighting candles; all began to pray devoutly. One heard sighing and
sobs, and over all a confused murmur of &ldquo;<i lang="la">requiem
&aelig;ternam</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little old man, with piercing eyes, entered uncovered. At sight of
him some laughed, others frowned. The old <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1594" href="#xd21e1594" name="xd21e1594">54</a>]</span>man seemed
to take no account of this. He went to the heap of skulls, knelt, and
searched with his eyes. Then with the greatest care he lifted the
skulls one by one, wrinkling his brows, shaking his head, and looking
on all sides. At length he rose and approached the grave-digger.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The other raised his eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you see a beautiful skull,
white as the inside of a cocoanut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave-digger shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the old man,
showing a piece of money; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all I have, but I&rsquo;ll
give it to you if you find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gleam of silver made the man reflect. He looked toward the heap
and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t there? No? Then I
don&rsquo;t know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? When those
who owe me pay, I&rsquo;ll give you more. &rsquo;Twas the skull of my
wife, and if you find it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t there? Then I know
nothing about it, but I can give you another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are like the grave you
dig,&rdquo; cried the old man, furious. &ldquo;You know not the value
of what you destroy! For whom is this <span class="corr" id="xd21e1617"
title="Source: gave">grave</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How do I know? For a dead
man!&rdquo; replied the other with temper.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Like the grave, like the
grave,&rdquo; the old man repeated with a dry laugh. &ldquo;You know
neither what you cast out nor what you keep. Dig! dig!&rdquo; And he
went toward the gate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the grave-digger had finished his task, and two mounds of
fresh, reddish earth rose beside the grave. Drawing from his pocket
some buyo, he regarded dully what was going on around him, sat down,
and began to chew.</p>
<p>At that moment a carriage, which had apparently made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1629" href="#xd21e1629" name=
"xd21e1629">55</a>]</span>a long journey, stopped at the entrance to
the cemetery. Ibarra got out, followed by an old servant, and silently
made his way along the path.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is there, behind the great
cross, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said the servant, as they approached the
spot where the grave-digger was sitting.</p>
<p>Arrived at the cross, the old servant looked on all sides, and
became greatly confused. &ldquo;It was there,&rdquo; he muttered;
&ldquo;no, there, but the ground has been broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him in anguish.</p>
<p>The servant appealed to the grave-digger.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where is the grave that was marked
with a cross like this?&rdquo; he demanded; and stooping, he traced a
Byzantine cross on the ground.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Were there flowers growing on
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, jasmine and
pansies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave-digger scratched his ear and said with a yawn:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, the cross I
burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Burned! and why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because the curate ordered
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra drew his hand across his forehead.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But at least you can show us the
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The body&rsquo;s no longer
there,&rdquo; said the grave-digger calmly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you saying!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man went on, with
a smile, &ldquo;I put a woman in its place, eight days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; cried the
servant; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t a year since he was buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso ordered it;
he told me to take the body to the Chinese cemetery;
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no farther, and started back in terror at sight of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1670" title=

<span class="corr" id="xd21e1673" title=

<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied the grave-digger, pale and trembling.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bury him with the Chinese. Better be drowned than
that, I thought to myself, and I threw him into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra stared at him like a madman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only a poor
fool!&rdquo; he said at length, and pushing him away, he rushed
headlong for the gate, stumbling over graves and bones, and painfully
followed by the old servant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the dead bring
us,&rdquo; grumbled the gravedigger. &ldquo;The curate orders me to dig
the man up, and this fellow breaks my arm for doing it. That&rsquo;s
the way with the Spaniards. I shall lose my place!&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Little Sacristans.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The little old man of the cemetery wandered
absent-minded along the streets.</p>
<p>He was a character of the pueblo. He had once been a student in
philosophy, but abandoned his course at the demands of his mother. The
good woman, finding that her son had talent, feared lest he become a
savant and forget God; she let him choose, therefore, between studying
for the priesthood and leaving the college of San Jos&eacute;. He was
in love, took the latter course, and married. Widowed and orphaned
within a year, he found in books a deliverance from sadness, idleness,
and the <i>gallera</i>. Unhappily he studied too much, bought too many
books, neglected to care for his fortune, and came to financial ruin.
Some people called him Don Astasio, or Tasio the philosopher; others,
and by far the greater number, Tasio the fool.</p>
<p>The afternoon threatened a tempest. Pale flashes of lightning
illumined the leaden sky; the atmosphere was heavy and close.</p>
<p>Arrived at the church door, Tasio entered and spoke to two little
boys, one ten years old perhaps, the other seven.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Coming with me?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Your mother has ready a dinner fit for curates.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The head sacristan won&rsquo;t let
us leave yet,&rdquo; said the elder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going into the
tower to ring the bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take care! don&rsquo;t go too near
the bells in the storm,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1707"
href="#xd21e1707" name="xd21e1707">58</a>]</span>said Tasio, and, head
down, he went off, thinking, toward the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>Soon the rain came down in torrents, the thunder echoed clap on
clap, each detonation preceded by an awful zig-zag of fire. The tempest
grew in fury, and, scarce able to ride on the shifting wind, the
plaintive voices of the bells rang out a lamentation.</p>
<p>The boys were in the tower, the younger, timid, in spite of his
great black eyes, hugging close to his brother. They resembled one
another, but the elder had the stronger and more thoughtful face. Their
dress was poor, patched, and darned. The wind beat in the rain a
little, where they were, and set the flame of their candle dancing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pull your rope, Crispin,&rdquo;
said the elder to his little brother.</p>
<p>Crispin pulled, and heard a feeble plaint, quickly silenced by a
thunder crash. &ldquo;If we were only home with mama,&rdquo; he
mourned, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other did not answer. He watched the candle melt, and seemed
thoughtful.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;At least, no one there would call
me a thief; mama would not have it. If she knew they had beaten
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The elder gave the great cord a sharp pull; a
deep, sonorous tone trembled out.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pay what they say I stole! Pay it,
brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you mad, Crispin? Mama would
have nothing to eat; they say you stole two onces, and two onces make
thirty-two pesos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little fellow counted thirty-two on his fingers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Six hands and two fingers. And
each finger makes a peso, and each peso how many cuartos?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A hundred sixty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And how much is a hundred
sixty?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Thirty-two hands.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1736" href="#xd21e1736" name=
"xd21e1736">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>Crispin regarded his little paws.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Thirty-two hands,&rdquo; he said,
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1742" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>and each finger a cuarto! O mama! how
many cuartos! and with them one could buy shoes, and a hat for the sun,
and an umbrella for the rain, and clothes for mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crispin became pensive.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m afraid of is that
mama will be angry with you when she hears about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; said Crispin,
surprised. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve never had a cuarto except the one they
gave me at Easter. Mama won&rsquo;t believe I stole; she won&rsquo;t
believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But if the curate says
so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crispin began to cry, and said through his sobs:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then go alone, I won&rsquo;t go.
Tell mama I&rsquo;m sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Crispin, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo;
said his brother. &ldquo;If mama seems to believe what they say,
you&rsquo;ll tell her that the sacristan lies, that the curate believes
him, that they say we are thieves because our
father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A head came out of the shadows in the little stairway, and as if it
had been Medusa&rsquo;s, it froze the words on the children&rsquo;s
lips.</p>
<p>The head was long and lean, with a shock of black hair. Blue glasses
concealed one sightless eye. It was the chief sacristan who had thus
stolen upon the children.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You, Basilio, are fined two
r&eacute;ales for not ringing regularly. And you, Crispin, stay
to-night till you find what you&rsquo;ve stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We have permission,&rdquo; began
Basilio; &ldquo;our mother expects us at nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go at nine
o&rsquo;clock either; you shall stay till ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;or, after nine one
can&rsquo;t pass through the streets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1772" href="#xd21e1772" name=
"xd21e1772">60</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you trying to dictate to
me?&rdquo; demanded the sacristan, and he seized Crispin&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, we have not seen our
mother for a week,&rdquo; entreated Basilio, taking hold of his brother
as if to protect him.</p>
<p>With a stroke on the cheek the sacristan made him let go, and
dragged off Crispin, who commenced to cry, let himself fall, tried to
cling to the floor, and besought Basilio to keep him. But the
sacristan, dragging the child, disappeared in the shadows.</p>
<p>Basilio stood mute. He heard his little brother&rsquo;s body strike
against the stairs; he heard a cry, blows, heart-rending words, growing
fainter and fainter, lost at last in the distance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When shall I be strong
enough?&rdquo; he murmured, and dashed down the stairs.</p>
<p>He reached the choir and listened. He could still hear his little
brother&rsquo;s voice; then over the cry,
&ldquo;Mama!&mdash;Brother!&rdquo; a door shut. Trembling, damp with
sweat, holding his mouth with his hand to stifle a cry, he stood a
moment looking about in the dim church. The doors were closed, the
windows barred. He went back to the tower, did not stop at the second
stage, where the bells were rung, but climbed to the third, loosed the
ropes that held the tongues of the bells, then went down again, pale,
his eyes gleaming, but without tears.</p>
<p>The rain commenced to slacken and the sky to clear. Basilio knotted
the ropes, fastened an end to a beam of the balcony, and, forgetting to
blow out the candle, glided down into the darkness.</p>
<p>Some minutes later voices were heard in a street of the pueblo, and
two rifle shots rang out; but it raised no alarm, and all again became
silent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1790" href="#xd21e1790"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">XIV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Sisa.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nearly an hour&rsquo;s walk from the pueblo lived the
mother of Basilio and Crispin, wife of a man who passed his time in
lounging or watching cock-fights while she struggled to bring up their
children. The husband and wife saw each other rarely, and their
interviews were painful. To feed his vices, he had robbed her of her
few trinkets, and when the unhappy Sisa had nothing more with which to
satisfy his caprices he began to abuse her. Without much strength of
will, dowered with more heart than reason, she only knew how to love
and to weep. Her husband was a god, her children were angels. He, who
knew how much he was adored and feared, like other false gods, grew
more and more arbitrary and cruel.</p>
<p>The stars were glittering in the sky cleared by the tempest. Sisa
sat on the wooden bench, her chin in her hand, watching some branches
smoulder on her hearth of uncut stones. On these stones was a little
pan where rice was cooking, and among the cinders were three dry
sardines.</p>
<p>She was still young, and one saw she had been beautiful. Her eyes,
which, with her soul, she had given to her sons, were fine, deep, and
fringed with dark lashes; her face was regular; her skin pure olive. In
spite of her youth, suffering, hunger sometimes, had begun to hollow
her cheeks. Her abundant hair, once her glory, was still carefully
dressed&mdash;but from habit, not coquetry.</p>
<p>All day Sisa had been thinking of the pleasure coming at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1804" href="#xd21e1804" name=
"xd21e1804">62</a>]</span>night. She picked the finest tomatoes in her
garden&mdash;favorite dish of little Crispin; from her neighbor, Tasio,
she got a fillet of wild boar and a wild duck&rsquo;s thigh for
Basilio, and she chose and cooked the whitest rice on the
threshing-floor.</p>
<p>Alas! the father arrived. Good-by to the dinner! He ate the rice,
the filet of wild boar, the duck&rsquo;s thigh, and the tomatoes. Sisa
said nothing, happy to see her husband satisfied, and so much happier
that, having eaten, he remembered he had children and asked where they
were. The poor mother smiled. She had promised herself to eat
nothing&mdash;there was not enough left for three; but the father had
thought of his sons, that was better than food.</p>
<p>Sisa, left alone, wept a little; but she thought of her children,
and dried her tears. She cooked the little rice she had left, and the
three sardines.</p>
<p>Attentive to every sound, she now sat listening: a footfall strong
and regular, it was Basilio&rsquo;s; light and unsteady,
Crispin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But the children did not come.</p>
<p>To pass the time, she hummed a song. Her voice was beautiful, and
when her children heard her sing &ldquo;Kundiman&rdquo; they cried,
without knowing why. To-night her voice trembled, and the notes came
tardily.</p>
<p>She went to the door and scanned the road. A black dog was there,
searching about. It frightened Sisa, and she threw a stone, sending the
dog off howling.</p>
<p>Sisa was not superstitious, but she had so often heard of black dogs
and presentiments that terror seized her. She shut the door in haste
and sat down by the light. She prayed to the Virgin, to God Himself, to
take care of her boys, and most for the little Crispin. Then, drawn
away from prayer by her sole preoccupation, she thought no longer of
aught but her children, of all their ways, which seemed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1821" href="#xd21e1821" name=
"xd21e1821">63</a>]</span>to her so pleasing. Then the terror returned.
Vision or reality, Crispin stood by the hearth, where he often sat to
chatter to her. He said nothing, but looked at her with great, pensive
eyes, and smiled.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother, open! Open the door,
mother!&rdquo; said Basilio&rsquo;s voice outside.</p>
<p>Sisa shuddered, and the vision disappeared. <span class=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Basilio had scarcely strength to enter and fall into
his mother&rsquo;s arms. A strange cold enveloped Sisa when she saw him
come alone. She wished to speak, but found no words; to caress her son,
but found no force. Yet at the sight of blood on his forehead, her
voice came, and she cried in a tone which seemed to tell of a breaking
heartstring:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My children!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, mama;
Crispin stayed at the convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;At the convent? He stayed at the
convent? Living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child raised his eyes to hers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, passing from
the greatest anguish to the utmost joy. She wept, embraced her child,
covered with kisses his wounded forehead.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And why are you hurt, my son? Did
you fall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basilio told her he had been challenged by the guard, ran, was shot
at, and a ball had grazed his forehead.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;O God! I thank Thee that Thou
didst save him!&rdquo; murmured the mother.</p>
<p>She went for lint and vinegar water, and while she bandaged his
wound:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;did
Crispin stay at the convent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basilio looked at her, kissed her, then little by little told the
story of the lost money; he said nothing of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1861" href="#xd21e1861" name=
"xd21e1861">65</a>]</span>torture of his little brother. Mother and
child mingled their tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Accuse my good Crispin! It&rsquo;s
because we are poor, and the poor must bear everything,&rdquo; murmured
Sisa. Both were silent a moment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you have not eaten,&rdquo;
said the mother. &ldquo;Here are sardines and rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry, mama; I only
want some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, eat,&rdquo; said the mother.
&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t like dry sardines, and I had something
else for you; but your father came, my poor child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My father came?&rdquo; and Basilio
instinctively examined his mother&rsquo;s face and hands.</p>
<p>The question pained the mother; she sighed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t eat? Then we must
go to bed; it is late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa barred the door and covered the fire. Basilio murmured his
prayers, and crept on the mat near his mother, who was still on her
knees. She was warm, he was cold. He thought of his little brother, who
had hoped to sleep this night close to his mother&rsquo;s side,
trembling with fear in some dark corner of the convent. He heard his
cries as he had heard them in the tower; but Nature soon confused his
ideas and he slept.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night Sisa wakened him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is it, Basilio? Why are you
crying?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I was dreaming. O mama! it was a
dream, wasn&rsquo;t it? Say it was nothing but a dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What were you dreaming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer, but sat up to dry his tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell me the dream,&rdquo; said
Sisa, when he had lain down again. &ldquo;I cannot sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is gone now, mama; I
don&rsquo;t remember it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa did not insist: she attached no importance to dreams.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mama,&rdquo; said Basilio after a
moment of silence, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1898" href="#xd21e1898" name="xd21e1898">66</a>]</span>not sleepy
either. I had a project last evening. I don&rsquo;t want to be a
sacristan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen, mama. The son of Don
Rafael came home from Spain to-day; he should be as kind as his father.
Well, to-morrow I find Crispin, get my pay, and say I&rsquo;m not going
to be a sacristan. Then I&rsquo;ll go see Don Cris&oacute;stomo and ask
him to make me a buffalo-keeper. Crispin could go on studying with old
Tasio. Tasio&rsquo;s better than the curate thinks; I&rsquo;ve often
seen him praying in the church when no one else was there. What shall I
lose in not being a sacristan? One earns little and loses it all in
fines. I&rsquo;ll be a herdsman, mama, and take good care of the cows
and <i>carabaos</i>, and make my master love me; then perhaps
he&rsquo;ll let us have a cow to milk: Crispin loves milk. And I could
fish in the rivers and go hunting when I get big. And by and by perhaps
I could have a little land and sow sugar-cane. We could all live
together, then. And old Tasio says Crispin is very bright. By and by we
would send him to study at Manila, and I would work for him. Shall we,
mama? He might be a doctor; what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What can I say, except that you
are right,&rdquo; answered Sisa, kissing her son.</p>
<p>Basilio went on with his projects, talking with the confidence of a
child. Sisa said yes to everything. But little by little sleep came
back to the child&rsquo;s lids, and this time he did not cry in his
dreams: that Ole-Luk-Oie, of whom Andersen tells us, unfurled over his
head the umbrella with its lining of gay pictures. But the mother, past
the age of careless slumbers, did not sleep. <span class=

<h2 class="main">At the Manse.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was seven o&rsquo;clock when Brother Salvi finished
his last mass. He took off his priestly robes without a word to any
one.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; whispered the
sacristans; &ldquo;it is going to rain fines! And all for the fault of
those children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father came out of the sacristy and crossed to the manse. On the
porch six or seven women sat waiting for him, and a man was walking to
and fro. The woman rose, and one bent to kiss his hand, but the priest
made such a gesture of impatience that she stopped short.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He must have lost a real
miser,&rdquo; she cried mockingly, when he had passed. &ldquo;This is
something unheard of: refuse his hand to the zealous Sister
Rufa?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He was not in the confessional
this morning,&rdquo; said a toothless old woman, Sister Sipa. &ldquo;I
wanted to confess, so as to get some indulgences.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have gained three plenary
indulgences,&rdquo; said a young woman of pleasing face, &ldquo;and
applied them all to the soul of my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have done wrong,&rdquo; said
Sister Rufa, &ldquo;one plenary is enough; you should not squander the
holy indulgences. Do as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I said to myself, the more there
are the better,&rdquo; replied young sister Juana, smiling; &ldquo;but
what do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sister Rufa did not respond at once; she chewed her <i>buyo</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1939" href="#xd21e1939" name=
"xd21e1939">68</a>]</span>and scanned her audience attentively; at
length she decided to speak.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, this is what I do. Suppose I
gain a year of indulgences; I say: Blessed Se&ntilde;or Saint Dominic,
have the kindness to see if there is some one in purgatory who has need
of precisely a year. Then I play heads or tails. If it falls heads, no;
if tails, yes. If it falls heads, I keep the indulgence, and so I make
groups of a hundred years, for which there is always use. It&rsquo;s a
pity one can&rsquo;t loan indulgences at interest. But do as I do,
it&rsquo;s the best plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Sisa appeared. She said good morning to the women, and
entered the manse.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone in, let us go
too,&rdquo; said the sisters, and they followed her.</p>
<p>Sisa felt her heart beat violently. She did not know what to say to
the curate in defence of her child. She had risen at daybreak, picked
all the fine vegetables left in her garden, and arranged them in a
basket with platane leaves and flowers, and had been to the river to
get a fresh salad of <i>pak&ocirc;</i>. Then, dressed in the best she
had, the basket on her head, without waking her son, she had set out
for the pueblo.</p>
<p>She went slowly through the manse, listening if by chance she might
hear a well-known voice, fresh and childish. But she met no one, heard
nothing, and went on to the kitchen.</p>
<p>The servants and sacristans received her coldly, scarcely answering
her greetings.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where may I put these
vegetables?&rdquo; she asked, without showing offence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There&mdash;wherever you want
to,&rdquo; replied the cook curtly.</p>
<p>Sisa, half-smiling, placed all in order on the table, and laid on
top the flowers and the tender shoots of the <i>pak&ocirc;</i>; then
she asked a servant who seemed more friendly than the cook:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1966" href="#xd21e1966" name=
"xd21e1966">69</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know if Crispin is in the
sacristy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Crispin?&rdquo; said he, wrinkling
his brows; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t he at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Basilio is, but Crispin stayed
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, yes, he stayed, but he ran off
afterward with all sorts of things he&rsquo;d stolen. The curate sent
me to report it at the quarters. The guards must be on their way to
your house by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa could not believe it; she opened her mouth, but her lips moved
in vain.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go find your children,&rdquo; said
the cook. &ldquo;Everybody sees you&rsquo;re a faithful woman; the
children are like their father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa stifled a sob, and, at the end of her strength, sat down.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry here,&rdquo; said
the cook still more roughly, &ldquo;the curate is ill; don&rsquo;t
bother him! Go cry in the street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor woman got up, almost by force, and went down the steps with
the sisters, who were still gossiping of the curate&rsquo;s illness.
Once on the street she looked about uncertain; then, as if from a
sudden resolution, moved rapidly away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The lake, girt with hills, lies tranquil, as if it had
not been shaken by yesterday&rsquo;s tempest. At the first gleam of
light which wakes the phosphorescent spirits of the water, almost on
the bounds of the horizon, gray silhouettes slowly take shape. These
are the barks of fishermen drawing in their nets; <i>cascos</i> and
<i>paraos</i> shaking out their sails.</p>
<p>From a height, two men in black are silently surveying the lake. One
is Ibarra, the other a young man of humble dress and melancholy
face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said the
stranger, &ldquo;where the gravedigger brought us, Lieutenant Guevara
and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra uncovered, and stood a long time as if in prayer.</p>
<p>When the first horror at the story of his father&rsquo;s desecrated
grave had passed, he had bravely accepted what could not be undone.
Private wrongs must go unavenged, if one would not add to the wrongs of
the country: Ibarra had been trained to live for these islands,
daughters of Spain. In his country, too, a charge against a monk was a
charge against the Church, and Cris&oacute;stomo was a loyal Catholic;
if he knew how in his mind to separate the Church from her unworthy
sons, most of his fellow-countrymen did not. And, again, his intimate
life was all here. The last of his race, his home was his family; he
loved ideally, and he loved the goddaughter of the malevolent priest.
He was rich, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2010" href=
"#xd21e2010" name="xd21e2010">71</a>]</span>therefore powerful
still&mdash;and he was young. Ibarra had taken up his life again as he
had found it.</p>
<p>His prayer finished, he warmly grasped the young man&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not thank me,&rdquo; said the
other; &ldquo;I owe everything to your father. I came here unknown;
your father protected me, encouraged my work, furnished the poor
children with books. How far away that good time seems!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! now we get along as best we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was silent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How many pupils have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;More than two hundred on the
list&mdash;in the classes, fifty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And how is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schoolmaster smiled sadly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I ask from
curiosity,&rdquo; said Ibarra. &ldquo;I have thought much about it, and
it seems to me better to try to carry out my father&rsquo;s ideas than
to weep or to avenge his death. I wish to inspire myself with his
spirit. That is why I ask this question.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The country will bless your
memory, se&ntilde;or, if you carry out the splendid projects of your
father. You wish to know the obstacles I meet? In a word, the plan of
instruction is hopeless. The children read, write, learn by heart
passages, sometimes whole books, in Castilian, without understanding a
single word. Of what use is such a school to the children of our
peasants!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You see the evil, what remedy do
you propose?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have none,&rdquo; said the young
man; &ldquo;one cannot struggle alone against so many needs and against
certain influences. I tried to remedy the evil of which I just spoke; I
tried to carry out the order of the Government, and began <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2041" href="#xd21e2041" name=
"xd21e2041">72</a>]</span>to teach the children Spanish. The beginning
was excellent, but one day Brother D&aacute;maso sent for me. I went up
immediately, and I said good-day to him in Castilian. Without replying,
he burst into laughter. At length he said, with a sidelong glance:
&lsquo;What <i lang="es">buenos dias! buenos dias!</i> It&rsquo;s very
pretty. You know Spanish?&rsquo; and he began to laugh
again.<span class="corr" id="xd21e2046" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Ibarra could not repress a smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You laugh,&rdquo; said the
teacher, &ldquo;and I, too, now; but I assure you I had no desire to
then. I started to reply, I don&rsquo;t know what, but Brother
D&aacute;maso interrupted:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-large">&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t wear clothes
that are not your own,&rsquo; he said in Tagal; &lsquo;be content to
speak your own language. Do you know about Ciruela? Well, Ciruela was a
master who could neither read nor write, yet he kept school.&rsquo; And
he left the room, slamming the door behind him. What was I to do? What
could I, against him, the highest authority of the pueblo, moral,
political, and civil; backed by his order, feared by the Government,
rich, powerful, always obeyed and believed. To withstand him was to
lose my place, and break off my career without hope of another. Every
one would have sided with the priest. I should have been called proud,
insolent, no Christian, perhaps even anti-Spanish and
<i>filibustero</i>. Heaven forgive me if I denied my conscience and my
reason, but I was born here, must live here, I have a mother, and I
abandoned myself to my fate, as a cadaver to the wave that rolls
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you lost all hope? You have
tried nothing since?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I was rash enough to try two more
experiments, one after our change of curates; but both proved offensive
to the same authority. Since then I have done my best to convert the
poor babies into parrots.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, I have cheerful news for
you,&rdquo; said Ibarra. &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2065" href="#xd21e2065" name="xd21e2065">73</a>]</span>am soon to
present to the Government a project that will help you out of your
difficulties, if it is approved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school-teacher shook his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will see, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,
that your projects&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard something of them&mdash;will
no more be realized than were mine!&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Story of a Mother.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sisa was running toward her poor little home. She had
experienced one of those convulsions of being which we know at the hour
of a great misfortune, when we see no possible refuge and all our hopes
take flight. If then a ray of light illumine some little corner, we fly
toward it without stopping to question.</p>
<p>Sisa ran swiftly, pursued by many fears and dark presentiments. Had
they already taken her Basilio? Where had her Crispin hidden?</p>
<p>As she neared her home, she saw two soldiers coming out of the
little garden. She lifted her eyes to heaven; heaven was smiling in its
ineffable light; little white clouds swam in the transparent blue.</p>
<p>The soldiers had left her house; they were coming away without her
children. Sisa breathed once more; her senses came back.</p>
<p>She looked again, this time with grateful eyes, at the sky, furrowed
now by a band of <i>garzas</i>, those clouds of airy gray peculiar to
the Philippines; confidence sprang again in her heart; she walked on.
Once past those dreadful men, she would have run, but prudence checked
her. She had not gone far, when she heard herself called imperiously.
She turned, pale and trembling in spite of herself. One of the guards
beckoned her.</p>
<p>Mechanically she obeyed: she felt her tongue grow paralyzed, her
throat parch. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2092" href=
"#xd21e2092" name="xd21e2092">75</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speak the truth, or we&rsquo;ll
tie you to this tree and shoot you,&rdquo; said one of the guards.</p>
<p>Sisa could do nothing but look at the tree.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are the mother of the
thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The mother of the thieves?&rdquo;
repeated Sisa, without comprehending.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where is the money your sons
brought home last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! the
money&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Give us the money, and we&rsquo;ll
let you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said the
unhappy woman, gathering her senses again, &ldquo;my boys do not steal,
even when they&rsquo;re hungry; we are used to suffering. I have not
seen my Crispin for a week, and Basilio did not bring home a cuarto.
Search the house, and if you find a r&eacute;al, do what you will with
us; the poor are not all thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said one of the
soldiers, fixing his eyes on Sisa&rsquo;s, &ldquo;follow us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&mdash;follow you?&rdquo; And she
drew back in terror, her eyes on the uniforms of the guards. &ldquo;Oh,
have pity on me! I&rsquo;m very poor, I&rsquo;ve nothing to give you,
neither gold nor jewelry. Take everything you find in my miserable
cabin, but let me&mdash;let me&mdash;die here in peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;March! do you hear? and if you
don&rsquo;t go without making trouble, we&rsquo;ll tie your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let me walk a little way in front
of you, at least,&rdquo; she cried, as they laid hold of her.</p>
<p>The soldiers spoke together apart.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said one,
&ldquo;when we get to the pueblo, you may. March on now, and
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Sisa thought she must die of shame. There was no one on the
road, it is true; but the air? and the light? She covered her face, in
her humiliation, and wept silently. She was indeed very miserable;
every one, even her husband, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2125"
href="#xd21e2125" name="xd21e2125">76</a>]</span>had abandoned her; but
until now she had always felt herself respected.</p>
<p>As they neared the pueblo, fear seized her. In her agony she looked
on all sides, seeking some succor in nature&mdash;death in the river
would be so sweet. But no! She thought of her children; here was a
light in the darkness of her soul.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Afterward,&rdquo; she said to
herself,&mdash;&ldquo;afterward, we will go to live in the heart of the
forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dried her eyes, and turning to the guards:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We are at the pueblo,&rdquo; she
said. Her tone was indescribable; at once a complaint, an argument, and
a prayer.</p>
<p>The soldiers took pity on her; they replied with a gesture. Sisa
went rapidly forward, then forced herself to walk tranquilly.</p>
<p>A tolling of bells announced the end of the high mass. Sisa
hastened, in the hope of avoiding the crowd from the church, but in
vain. Two women she knew passed, looked at her questioningly; she bowed
with an anguished smile, then, to avoid new mortifications, she fixed
her eyes on the ground.</p>
<p>At sight of her people turned, whispered, followed with their eyes,
and though her eyes were turned away, she divined, she felt, she saw it
all. A woman who by her bare head, her dress, and her manners showed
what she was, cried boldly to the soldiers:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where did you find her? Did you
get the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa seemed to have taken a blow in the face. The ground gave way
under her feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; cried a
guard.</p>
<p>Like an automaton whose mechanism is broken she turned quickly, and,
seeing nothing, feeling nothing but instinct, tried to hide herself. A
gate was before her; she would have entered but a voice still more
imperious checked her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2150" href=
"#xd21e2150" name="xd21e2150">77</a>]</span>While she sought to find
whence the voice came, she felt herself pushed along by the shoulders.
She closed her eyes, took two steps, then her strength left her and she
fell.</p>
<p>It was the barracks. In the yard were soldiers, women, pigs, and
chickens. Some of the women were helping the men mend their clothes or
clean their arms, and humming ribald songs.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where is the sergeant?&rdquo;
demanded one of the guards angrily. &ldquo;Has the alf&eacute;rez been
informed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shrug of the shoulders was the sole response; no one would take
any trouble for the poor woman.</p>
<p>Two long hours she stayed there, half mad, crouched in a corner, her
face hidden in her hands, her hair undone. At noon the alf&eacute;rez
arrived. He refused to believe the curate&rsquo;s accusations.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah! monks&rsquo; tricks!&rdquo;
said he; and ordered that the woman be released and the affair
dropped.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If he wants to find what
he&rsquo;s lost,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;let him complain to the
nuncio! That&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa, who could scarcely move, was almost carried out of the
barracks. When she found herself in the street, she set out as fast as
she could for her home, her head bare, her hair loose, her eyes fixed.
The sun, then in the zenith, burned with all his fire: not a cloud
veiled his resplendent disc. The wind just moved the leaves of the
trees; not a bird dared venture from the shade of the branches.</p>
<p>At length Sisa arrived. Troubled, silent, she entered her poor
cabin, ran all about it, went out, came in, went out again. Then she
ran to old Tasio&rsquo;s, knocked at the door. Tasio was not there. The
poor thing went back and commenced to call, &ldquo;Basilio!
Crispin!&rdquo; standing still, listening attentively. An echo
repeating her calls, the sweet murmur of water from the river, the
music of the reeds stirred by the breeze, were the sole voices of the
solitude. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2168" href="#xd21e2168"
name="xd21e2168">78</a>]</span>She called anew, mounted a hill, went
down into a ravine; her wandering eyes took a sinister expression; from
time to time sharp lights flashed in them, then they were obscured,
like the sky in a tempest. One might have said the light of reason,
ready to go out, revived and died down in turn.</p>
<p>She went back, and sat down on the mat where they had slept the
night before&mdash;she and Basilio&mdash;and raised her eyes. Caught in
the bamboo fence on the edge of the precipice, she saw a piece of
Basilio&rsquo;s blouse. She got up, took it, and examined it in the
sunlight. There were blood spots on it, but Sisa did not seem to see
them. She bent over and continued to look at this rag from her
child&rsquo;s clothing, raised it in the air, bathing it in the brazen
rays. Then, as if the last gleam of light within her had finally gone
out, she looked straight at the sun, with wide-staring eyes.</p>
<p>At length she began to wander about, crying out strange sounds. One
hearing her would have been frightened; her voice had a quality the
human larynx would hardly know how to produce.</p>
<p>The sun went down; night surprised her. Perhaps Heaven gave her
sleep, and an angel&rsquo;s wing, brushing her pale forehead, took away
that memory which no longer recalled anything but griefs. The next day
Sisa roamed about, smiling, singing, and conversing with all the beings
of great Nature.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Three days passed, and the inhabitants of San Diego had ceased to
talk or think of unhappy Sisa and her boys. Maria Clara, who,
accompanied by Aunt Isabel, had just arrived from Manila, was the chief
subject of conversation. Every one rejoiced to see her, for every one
loved her. They marvelled at her beauty, and speculated about her
marriage with Ibarra. On this evening, Cris&oacute;stomo presented
himself at the home of his fianc&eacute;e; the curate arrived at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2181" href="#xd21e2181" name=
"xd21e2181">79</a>]</span>same moment. The house was a delicious little
nest among orange-trees and ylang-ylang. They found Maria by an open
window, overlooking the lake, surrounded by the fresh foliage and
delicate perfume of vines and flowers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The winds blow fresh,&rdquo; said
the curate; &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you afraid of taking cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel the wind,
father,&rdquo; said Maria.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We Filipinos,&rdquo; said
Cris&oacute;stomo, &ldquo;find this season of autumn and spring
together delicious. Falling leaves and budding trees in February, and
ripe fruit in March, with no cold winter between, is very agreeable.
And when the hot months come we know where to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest smiled, and the conversation turned to the pueblo and the
festival of its patron saint, which was near.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speaking of f&ecirc;tes,&rdquo;
said Cris&oacute;stomo to the curate, &ldquo;we hope you will join us
in a picnic to-morrow, near the great fig-tree in the wood. The
arrangements are all made as you wished, Maria. A small party is to
start for the fishing-ground before sunrise,&rdquo; he went on to the
curate, &ldquo;and later we hope to be joined by all our friends of the
pueblo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate said he should be happy to come after his services were
said. They chatted a few moments longer, and then Ibarra excused
himself to finish giving his invitations and make his final
arrangements.</p>
<p>As he left the house a man saluted him respectfully.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked
Cris&oacute;stomo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You would not know my name,
se&ntilde;or; I have been trying to see you for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, my wife has gone
mad, my children are lost, and no one will help me find them. I want
your aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said
Ibarra.</p>
<p>The man thanked him, and they disappeared together in the darkness
of the unlighted streets. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2210"

<h2 class="label">XIX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Fishing Party.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The stars were yet brilliant in the sapphire vault,
and in the branches the birds were still asleep when a merry party went
through the streets of the pueblo, toward the lake, lighted by the
glimmer of the pitch torches here called huepes.</p>
<p>There were five young girls, walking rapidly, holding each other by
the hand or waist, followed by several elderly ladies, and servants
bearing gracefully on their heads baskets of provisions. To see these
girls&rsquo; faces, laughing with youth, to judge by their abundant
black hair flying free in the wind, and the ample folds of their
garments, we might take them for divinities of the night fleeing at the
approach of day; but they were Maria Clara and her four friends, the
merry Sinang, her cousin, the calm Victoria, beautiful Iday, and
pensive Neneng. They talked with animation, pinched each other,
whispered in each other&rsquo;s ears, and pealed out merry rounds of
laughter.</p>
<p>After a while there came to meet the party a group of young men,
carrying torches of reeds. They were walking, silent, to the sound of a
guitar.</p>
<p>When the two groups met, the girls became serious and grave. The
men, on the contrary, talked, laughed, and asked six questions to get
half a reply.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is the lake smooth? Do you think
we shall have a fine day?&rdquo; demanded the mamas.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be disturbed,
se&ntilde;oras, I&rsquo;m a splendid swimmer,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2228" href="#xd21e2228" name=
"xd21e2228">81</a>]</span>said a tall, slim fellow, a merry-looking
rascal with an air of mock gravity.</p>
<p>But they were already at the borders of the lake, and cries of
delight escaped the lips of the women. They saw two great barks, bound
together, picturesquely decked with garlands of flowers and
various-colored festoons of fluffy drapery. Little paper lanterns hung
alternating with roses, pinks, pineapples, bananas, and guavas. Rudders
and oars were decorated too, and there were mats, rugs, and cushions to
make comfortable seats for the ladies. In the boat, most beautifully
trimmed, were a harp, guitars, accordeons, and a carabao&rsquo;s horn;
in the other burned a ship&rsquo;s fire; and tea, coffee and
salabat&mdash;a tea of ginger sweetened with honey&mdash;were making
for the first breakfast.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The women here, the men
there,&rdquo; said the mamas, embarking; &ldquo;move carefully,
don&rsquo;t stir the boat or we shall capsize!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re to be in here all
alone?&rdquo; pouted Sinang.</p>
<p>Slowly the boats left the beach, reflecting in the mirror of the
lake the many lights of their lanterns. In the east were the first
streaks of dawn.</p>
<p>Comparative silence reigned. The separation established by the
ladies seemed to have dedicated youth to meditation. The water was
perfectly tranquil, the fishing-grounds were near; it was soon decided
to abandon the oars, and breakfast. Day had come, and the lanterns were
put out.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful morning. The light falling from the sky and
reflected from the water made radiant the surface of the lake, and
bathed everything in an atmosphere of clearness saturated with color,
such as some marines suggest. Everybody, even the mamas, laughed and
grew merry. &ldquo;Do you remember, when we were girls&mdash;&rdquo;
they began to each other; and Maria and her young companions exchanged
smiling glances. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2243" href=
"#xd21e2243" name="xd21e2243">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>One man alone remained a stranger to this gayety&mdash;it was the
helmsman. Young, of athletic build, his melancholy eyes and the severe
lines of his lips gave an interest to his face, and this was heightened
by his long black hair falling naturally about his muscular neck. His
wrists of steel managed like a feather the large and heavy oar which
served as rudder to guide the two barks.</p>
<p>Maria Clara had several times met his eyes, but he quickly turned
them away to the shores or the mountains. Pitying his solitude, she
offered him some cakes. With a certain surprise he took one, refusing
the others, and thanked her in a voice scarcely audible. No one else
seemed to think of him.</p>
<p>The early breakfast done, the party moved off toward the fishing
enclosures. There were two, a little distance apart, both the property
of Captain Tiago. In advance, a flock of white herons could be seen,
some moving among the reeds, some flying here and there, skimming the
water with their wings, and filling the air with their strident cries.
Maria Clara followed them with her eyes, as, at the approach of the two
barks, they flew away from the shore.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do these birds have their nests in
the mountains?&rdquo; she asked the helmsman, less perhaps from the
wish to know than to make the silent fellow talk.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Probably, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;but no one has ever yet seen them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They have no nests,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I suppose they must have; if not,
they are unhappy indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara did not catch the note of sadness in his voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They say, se&ntilde;ora, that the
nests of these birds are invisible, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2265" href="#xd21e2265" name="xd21e2265">83</a>]</span>and have
the power to render invisible whoever holds them; that as the soul can
be seen only in the mirror of the eyes, so these nests can be seen only
in the mirror of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara became pensive. But they had come to the first baklad,
as the enclosures are called. The old sailor in charge attached the
boats to the reeds, while his son prepared to mount with lines and
nets.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; cried Aunt
Isabel, &ldquo;the fish must come directly out of the water into the
pan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What, good Aunt Isabel!&rdquo;
said Albino reproachfully, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you give the poor things
a moment in the air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andeng, Maria&rsquo;s foster-sister, was a famous cook. She began to
prepare rice water, the tomatoes, and the camias; the young men,
perhaps to win her good graces, aided her, while the other girls
arranged the melons, and cut paayap into cigarette-like strips.</p>
<p>To while away the time Iday took up the harp, the instrument most
often played in this part of the islands. She played well, and was much
applauded. Maria thanked her with a kiss.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sing, Victoria, sing the
&lsquo;Marriage Song,&rsquo;&rdquo; demanded the ladies. This is a
beautiful Tagal elegy of married life, but sad, painting its miseries
rather than its joys. The men clamored for it too, and Victoria had a
lovely voice; but she was hoarse. So Maria Clara was begged to
sing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All my songs are sad,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said her
companions, and without more urging she took the harp and sang in a
rich and vibrant voice, full of feeling.</p>
<p>The chant ceased, the harp became mute; yet no one applauded; they
seemed listening still. The young girls felt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2285" href="#xd21e2285" name=
"xd21e2285">84</a>]</span>their eyes fill with tears; Ibarra seemed
disturbed; the helmsman, motionless, was gazing far away.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a crash like thunder. The women cried out and
stopped their ears. It was Albino, filling with all the force of his
lungs the carabao&rsquo;s horn. There needed nothing more to bring back
laughter, and dry tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you wish to make us deaf,
pagan?&rdquo; cried Aunt Isabel.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of a poor trumpeter who, from simply playing on
his instrument, became the husband of a rich and noble lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So he did&mdash;the Trumpeter of
S&auml;ckingen!&rdquo; laughed Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Albino,
&ldquo;we shall see if I am as happy!&rdquo; and he began to blow again
with still more force. There was a panic: the mamas attacked him hand
and foot.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ouch! ouch!&rdquo; he cried,
rubbing his hurts; &ldquo;the Philippines are far from the borders of
the Rhine! For the same deed one is knighted, another put in the
san-benito!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last Andeng announced the kettle ready for the fish.</p>
<p>The fisherman&rsquo;s son now climbed the weir or
&ldquo;purse&rdquo; of the enclosure. It was almost circular, a yard
across, so arranged that a man could stand on top to draw out the fish
with a little net or with a line.</p>
<p>All watched him, some thinking they saw already the quiver of the
little fishes and the shimmer of their silver scales.</p>
<p>The net was drawn up; nothing in it; the line, no fish adorned it.
The water fell back in a shower of drops, and laughed a silvery laugh.
A cry of disappointment escaped from every mouth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand your
business,&rdquo; said Albino, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2310"
href="#xd21e2310" name="xd21e2310">85</a>]</span>climbing up by the
young man; and he took the net. &ldquo;Look now! Ready,
Andeng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Albino was no better fisherman. Everybody laughed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a noise,
you&rsquo;ll drive away the fish. The net must be broken.&rdquo; But
every mesh was intact.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; said
L&eacute;on, the fianc&eacute;e of Iday. &ldquo;Are you sure no one has
been here for five days?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Absolutely sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then either the lake is enchanted
or I draw out something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cast the line, looked annoyed, dragged the hook along in the
water and murmured:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A crocodile!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A crocodile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word passed from mouth to mouth amid general stupefaction.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Capture him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But nobody offered to go down. The water was deep.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We ought to drag him in triumph at
our stern,&rdquo; said Sinang; &ldquo;he has eaten our fish!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a crocodile
alive,&rdquo; mused Maria Clara.</p>
<p>The helmsman got up, took a rope, lithely climbed the little
platform, and in spite of warning cries dived into the weir. The water,
troubled an instant, became smooth; the abyss closed mysteriously.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Heaven!&rdquo; cried the women,
&ldquo;we are going to have a catastrophe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was agitated: a combat seemed to be going on below. Above,
there was absolute silence. Ibarra held his blade in a convulsive
grasp. Then the struggle seemed to end, and the young man&rsquo;s head
appeared. He was saluted with joyous cries. He climbed the platform,
holding in one hand an end of the rope. Then he pulled with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2348" href="#xd21e2348" name=
"xd21e2348">86</a>]</span>all his strength, and the monster came in
view. The rope was round its neck and the fore part of its body; it was
large, and on its back could be seen green moss&mdash;to a crocodile
what white hair is to man. It bellowed like an ox, beat the reeds with
its tail, crouched, and opened its jaws, black and terrifying, showing
its long and saw-like teeth. No one thought of aiding the helmsman.
When he had drawn the reptile out of the water he put his foot on it,
closed with his robust hand the redoubtable jaws, and tried to tie the
muzzle. The creature made a last effort, arched its body, beat about
with its powerful tail, and escaping, plunged outside the enclosure
into the lake, dragging its vanquisher after it. The helmsman was a
dead man. A cry of horror escaped from every mouth.</p>
<p>Like a flash, another body disappeared in the water. There scarce
was time to see it was Ibarra&rsquo;s. If Maria Clara did not faint, it
was that the natives of the Philippines do not yet know how.</p>
<p>The waters grew red. Then the young fisherman leaped in, his father
followed him. But they had scarcely disappeared, when Ibarra and the
helmsman came to the surface, clinging to the crocodile&rsquo;s body.
Its white belly was lacerated, Ibarra&rsquo;s knife was in the
gorge.</p>
<p>Many arms stretched out to help the two young men from the water.
The mamas, hysterical, wept, laughed, and prayed. Ibarra was unharmed.
The helmsman had a slight scratch on the arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I owe you my life,&rdquo; said he
to Ibarra, who was being wrapped in mantles and rugs.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are too intrepid,&rdquo; said
Ibarra. &ldquo;Another time do not tempt God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you had not come back!&rdquo;
murmured Maria Clara, pale and trembling.</p>
<p>The ladies did not approve of going to the second baklad;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2365" href="#xd21e2365" name=
"xd21e2365">87</a>]</span>to their minds the day had begun ill; there
could not fail to be other misfortunes; it were better to go home.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But what misfortune have we
had?&rdquo; said Ibarra. &ldquo;The crocodile alone has the right to
complain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the mamas were persuaded, and the barks took their course
toward the second baklad. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2371"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There had not been much hope in this second baklad.
Every one expected to find there the crocodile&rsquo;s mate; but the
net always came up full. The fishing ended, the boats were turned
toward the shore. There was the party of the townspeople whom Ibarra
had invited to meet his guests of the morning, and lunch with them
under improvised tents beside a brook, in the shade of the ancient
trees of the wooded peninsula. Music was resounding in the place, and
water sang in the kettles. The body of the crocodile, in tow of the
boats, turned from side to side; sometimes presenting its belly, white
and torn, sometimes its spotted back and mossy shoulders. Man, the
favorite of nature, is little disturbed by his many fratricides.</p>
<p>The party dispersed, some going to the baths, some wandering among
the trees. The silent young helmsman disappeared. A path with many
windings crossed the thicket of the wood and led to the upper course of
the warm brook, formed from some of the many thermal springs on the
flanks of the Makiling. Along the banks of the stream grew wood
flowers, many of which have no Latin names, but are none the less known
to golden bugs, to butterflies, shaded, jewelled, and bronzed, and to
thousands of coleopters powdered with gold and gleaming with facets of
steel. The hum of these insects, the song of birds, or the dry sound of
dead branches catching in their fall, alone broke the mysterious
silence. Suddenly the tones of fresh, young voices <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2381" href="#xd21e2381" name=
"xd21e2381">89</a>]</span>were added to the wood notes. They seemed to
come down the brook.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall see if I find a
nest!&rdquo; said a sweet and resonant voice. &ldquo;I should like to
see him without his seeing me. I should like to follow him
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in
heron&rsquo;s nests,&rdquo; said another voice; &ldquo;but if I were in
love, I should know how at once to see and to be invisible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Maria Clara, Victoria, and Sinang walking in the brook. Their
eyes were on the water, where they were searching for the mysterious
nest. In blouses striped with dainty colors, their full bath skirts wet
to the knees, outlining the graceful curves of their bodies, they moved
along, seeking the impossible, meanwhile picking flowers along the
banks. Soon the little stream bent its course, and the tall reeds hid
the charming trio and cut off the sound of their voices.</p>
<p>A little farther on, in the middle of the stream, was a sort of
bath, well enclosed, its roof of leafy bamboo; palm leaves, flowers,
and streamers decked its sides. From here, too, came girls&rsquo;
voices. Farther on was a bamboo bridge, and beyond that the men were
bathing, while a multitude of servants were busy plucking fowls,
washing rice, roasting pigs. In the clearing on the opposite bank a
group of men and women had formed under a great canvas roof, attached
in part to the branches of the ancient trees, in part to pickets. There
chatted the curate, the alf&eacute;rez, the vicar, the gobernadorcillo,
the lieutenant, all the chief men of the town, including the famous
orator, Captain Basilio, father of Sinang and opponent of Don Rafael
Ibarra in a lawsuit not yet ended.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We dispute a point at law,&rdquo;
Cris&oacute;stomo had said in inviting him, &ldquo;but to dispute is
not to be enemies,&rdquo; and the famous orator had accepted the
invitation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2393" href="#xd21e2393"
name="xd21e2393">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bottles of lemonade were opened and green cocoanut shells were
broken, so that those who came from the baths might drink the fresh
water; the girls were given wreaths of ylang-ylang and roses to perfume
their unbound hair.</p>
<p>The lunch hour came. The curate, the alf&eacute;rez, the
gobernadorcillo, some captains, and the lieutenant sat at a table with
Ibarra. The mamas allowed no men at the table with the girls.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you learned anything,
se&ntilde;or alf&eacute;rez, about the criminal who attacked Brother
D&aacute;maso?&rdquo; said Brother Salvi.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Of what criminal are you
speaking?&rdquo; asked the alf&eacute;rez, looking at the father over
his glass of wine.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What? Why, the one who attacked
Brother D&aacute;maso on the highway day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso has been
attacked?&rdquo; asked several voices.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes; he is in bed yet. It is
thought the maker of the assault is Elias, the one who threw you into
the swamp some time ago, se&ntilde;or alf&eacute;rez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez reddened with shame, if it were not from emptying
his glass of wine.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But I supposed you were
informed,&rdquo; the curate went on; &ldquo;I said to myself that the
alf&eacute;rez of the Municipal Guard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer bit his lip.</p>
<p>At that moment a woman, pale, thin, miserably dressed, appeared,
like a phantom, in the midst of the feast.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Give the poor woman something to
eat,&rdquo; said the ladies.</p>
<p>She kept on toward the table where the curate was seated. He turned,
recognized her, and the knife fell from his hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Give the woman something to
eat,&rdquo; ordered Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The night is dark and the children
are gone,&rdquo; murmured the poor woman. But at sight of the
alf&eacute;rez she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2426" href=
"#xd21e2426" name="xd21e2426">91</a>]</span>became frightened and ran,
disappearing among the trees.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; demanded several
voices.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t her name Sisa?&rdquo;
asked Ibarra with interest.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your soldiers arrested her,&rdquo;
said the lieutenant to the alf&eacute;rez, with some bitterness;
&ldquo;they brought her all the way across the pueblo for some story
about her sons that nobody could clear up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; demanded the
alf&eacute;rez, turning to the curate. &ldquo;It is perhaps the mother
of your sacristans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate nodded assent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They have disappeared, and there
hasn&rsquo;t been the slightest effort to find them,&rdquo; said Don
Filipo severely, looking at the gobernadorcillo, who lowered his
eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bring back the woman,&rdquo;
Cris&oacute;stomo ordered his servants.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They have disappeared, did you
say?&rdquo; demanded the alf&eacute;rez. &ldquo;Your sacristans have
disappeared, Father Salvi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate emptied his glass and made another affirmative sign.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ho, ho! father,&rdquo; cried the
alf&eacute;rez with a mocking laugh, rejoiced at the prospect of
revenge. &ldquo;Your reverence loses a few pesos, and my sergeant is
routed out to find them; your two sacristans disappear, your reverence
says nothing; and you also, se&ntilde;or gobernadorcillo, you
also&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish, but broke off laughing, and buried his spoon in
the red flesh of a papaw.</p>
<p>The curate began with some confusion:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I was responsible for the
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Excellent reply, reverend pastor
of souls!&rdquo; interrupted the alf&eacute;rez, his mouth full.
&ldquo;Excellent reply, holy man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was on the point of interfering, but the priest recovered
himself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2459" href="#xd21e2459"
name="xd21e2459">92</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know, se&ntilde;or
alf&eacute;rez,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what is said about the
disappearance of these children? No? Then ask your soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the
alf&eacute;rez, thus challenged, abandoning his mocking tone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They say that on the night when
they disappeared shots were heard in the pueblo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Shots?&rdquo; repeated the
alf&eacute;rez, looking at the faces around him. There were several
signs of assent.</p>
<p>Brother Salvi went on with a sarcastic smile:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come! I see that you do not know
how to arrest criminals, that you are unaware of what your soldiers do,
but that you are ready to turn yourself into a preacher and teach
others their duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; interrupted
Ibarra, seeing the alf&eacute;rez grow pale, &ldquo;I wish to know what
you think of a project I&rsquo;ve formed. I should like to give the
mother into the care of a good physician. I&rsquo;ve promised the
father to try to find his children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The return of the servants without Sisa gave a new turn to the
conversation. The luncheon was finished. While the tea and coffee were
being served the guests separated into groups, the elders to play cards
or chess, while the girls, curious to learn their destiny, posed
questions to the &ldquo;Wheel of Fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra!&rdquo;
cried Captain Basilio, a little gayer than usual; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
had a case in court for fifteen years and no judge is able to solve it;
let&rsquo;s see if we cannot end it at chess.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In a moment, with great
pleasure,&rdquo; said Ibarra; &ldquo;the alf&eacute;rez is leaving
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the officer had gone the men grouped around the two
players. It was to be an interesting game. The elder ladies meanwhile
had surrounded the curate, to talk <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2483" href="#xd21e2483" name="xd21e2483">93</a>]</span>with him
of the things of religion; but Brother Salvi seemed to judge the time
unfitting and made but vague replies, his rather irritated glance being
directed almost everywhere except toward his questioners.</p>
<p>The chess players began with much solemnity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If the game is a tie, the affair
is forgotten!&rdquo; said Ibarra.</p>
<p>In the midst of the play he received a despatch. His eyes shone and
he became pale, but he put the message in his pocket without opening
it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Check!&rdquo; he cried. Captain
Basilio had no recourse but to hide his king behind the queen.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Check!&rdquo; said Ibarra,
threatening with his castle.</p>
<p>Captain Basilio asked a moment to reflect.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said Ibarra;
&ldquo;I, too, should like a moment,&rdquo; and excusing himself he
went toward the group round the &ldquo;Wheel of Fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iday had the disc on which were the forty-eight questions, Albino
the book of replies.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ask something,&rdquo; they all
cried to Ibarra, as he came up. &ldquo;The one who has the best answer
is to receive a present from the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And who has had the best so
far?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria Clara!&rdquo; cried Sinang.
&ldquo;We made her ask whether her lover is constant and true, and the
book said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Maria, all blushes, put her hand over Sinang&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Give me the &lsquo;Wheel&rsquo;
then,&rdquo; said Cris&oacute;stomo, smiling. And he asked:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Shall I succeed in my present
undertaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a stupid question!&rdquo;
pouted Sinang.</p>
<p>The corresponding answer was found in the book. &ldquo;&lsquo;Dreams
are dreams,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Albino. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2518" href="#xd21e2518" name="xd21e2518">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ibarra brought out his telegram and opened it, trembling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This time your wheel lies!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Read!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-large">&ldquo;&lsquo;Project for school
approved.&rsquo; What does that mean?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This is my present,&rdquo; said
he, giving the despatch to Maria Clara. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to build a
school in the pueblo; the school is my offering.&rdquo; And the young
fellow ran back to his game of chess.</p>
<p>After making this present to his fianc&eacute;e, Ibarra was so happy
that he played without reflection, and, thanks to his many false moves,
the captain re-established himself, and the game was a draw. The two
men shook hands with effusion.</p>
<p>While they were thus making an end of the long and tedious suit, the
sudden appearance of a sergeant and four armed guards, bayonets fixed,
broke rudely in upon the merry-makers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Whoever stirs is a dead
man!&rdquo; cried the sergeant.</p>
<p>In spite of this bluster, Ibarra went up to him and asked what he
wanted.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We want a criminal named Elias,
who was your helmsman this morning,&rdquo; replied the officer, still
threatening.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A criminal? The helmsman? You must
be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or, this Elias is
accused of having raised his hand against a priest. You admit
questionable people to your f&ecirc;tes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked him over from head to foot and replied with great
coldness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am in no way accountable to you
for my actions. Every one is welcome at my f&ecirc;tes.&rdquo; And he
turned away.</p>
<p>The sergeant, finding he was making no headway, ordered his men to
search on all sides. They had the helmsman&rsquo;s description on
paper.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Notice that this description
answers well for nine-tenths <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2551"
href="#xd21e2551" name="xd21e2551">95</a>]</span>of the natives,&rdquo;
said Don Filipo; &ldquo;see that you make no mistakes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quiet came back little by little. There were no end of
questions.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So this is the Elias who threw the
alf&eacute;rez into the swamp,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tulisane then?&rdquo;
asked Victoria, trembling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I think not, for I know that he
once fought against the tulisanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t the face of a
criminal,&rdquo; said Sinang.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; but his face is very
sad,&rdquo; said Maria. &ldquo;I did not see him smile all the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was ending, and in the last rays of the setting sun
everybody left the wood, passing in silence the tomb of Ibarra&rsquo;s
ancestor. Farther on conversation again became animated, gay, full of
warmth, under these branches little used to merry-making. But the trees
appeared sad, and the swaying bindweed seemed to say: &ldquo;Adieu,
youth! Adieu, dream of a day!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">With the Philosopher.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next morning, Juan Cris&oacute;stomo Ibarra, after
visiting his land, turned his horse toward old Tasio&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Complete quiet reigned in the old man&rsquo;s garden; scarcely did
the swallows make a sound as they flew round the roof. The old walls of
the house were mossy, and ivy framed the windows. It seemed the abode
of silence.</p>
<p>Ibarra tied his horse, crossed the neat garden, almost on tiptoe,
and entered the open door. He found the old man in his study,
surrounded by his collections of insects and leaves, his maps,
manuscript, and books. He was writing, and so absorbed in his work that
he did not notice the entrance of Ibarra until the young man, loath to
disturb him, was leaving as quietly as he had come.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! you were there?&rdquo; he
cried, looking at Cris&oacute;stomo with a certain astonishment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself; I
see you are busy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I was writing a little, but it is
not at all pressing. Can I be of service to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Of great service,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, approaching; &ldquo;but&mdash;you are deciphering
hieroglyphics!&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise, catching sight of the
old man&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m writing in
hieroglyphics.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Writing in hieroglyphics? And
why?&rdquo; demanded the young man, doubting his senses.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So that no one can read
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him attentively, wondering if he were not a little
mad after all. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2596" href=
"#xd21e2596" name="xd21e2596">97</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And why do you write if you do not
wish to be read?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I write not for this generation,
but for future ages. If the men of to-day could read my books, they
would burn them; the generation that deciphers these characters will
understand, and will say: &lsquo;Our ancestors did not all
sleep.&rsquo; But you have something to ask of me, and we are talking
of other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra drew out some papers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that my father greatly valued your advice, and I have come to
ask it for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he briefly explained his project for the school, unrolling
before the stupefied philosopher plans sent from Manila. &ldquo;Whom
shall I consult first, in the pueblo, whose support will avail me most?
You know them all, I am almost a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Tasio examined with tearful eyes the drawings before him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are going to realize my
dream,&rdquo; he said, greatly moved; &ldquo;the dream of a poor fool.
And now the first advice I give you is never to ask advice of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because, if you do,&rdquo; he
continued with bitter irony, &ldquo;all sensible people will take you
for a fool, too. For all sensible people think those who differ with
them fools; they think me one, and I am grateful for it, because the
day they see in me a reasonable being woe is me! That day I shall lose
the little liberty I now enjoy at the expense of my reputation. The
gobernadorcillo passes with them for a wise man because having learned
nothing but to serve chocolate and to suffer the caprices of Brother
D&aacute;maso, he is now rich and has the right to trouble the life of
his fellow-citizens. &lsquo;There is a man of talent!&rsquo; says the
crowd. &lsquo;He has sprung from nothing to greatness.&rsquo; But
perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2615" href="#xd21e2615"
name="xd21e2615">98</a>]</span>I am really the fool and they are the
wise men. Who can say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old man shook his head as though to dismiss an unwelcome
thought.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The second thing I advise is to
consult the curate, the gobernadorcillo, all the people of position in
the pueblo. They will give you bad advice, unintelligible, useless. But
to ask advice is not to follow it. All you need is to make it
understood that you are working in accordance with their
ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra reflected, then replied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No doubt your counsel is good, but
it is very hard to take. May I not offer my own ideas to the light of
day? Cannot the good make its way anywhere? Has truth need of the dross
of error?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No one likes the naked
truth,&rdquo; replied the old man. &ldquo;It is good in theory, easy in
the ideal world of which youth dreams. You say you are a stranger to
your country; I believe it. The day that you arrived here, you began by
wounding the self-esteem of a priest. God grant this seemingly small
thing has not decided your future. If it has, all your efforts will
break against the convent walls, without disturbing the monk, swaying
his girdle, or making his robe tremble. The alcalde, under one pretext
or another, will deny you to-morrow what he grants you to-day; not a
mother will let her child go to your school, and the result of all your
efforts will be simply negative.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I cannot help feeling your fears
exaggerated,&rdquo; said Ibarra. &ldquo;In spite of all you say, I
cannot believe in this power; but even admitting it to be so great, the
most intelligent of the people would be on my side, and also the
Government, which is animated by the best intentions, and wishes the
veritable good of the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Government! the
Government!&rdquo; murmured the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2632" href="#xd21e2632" name=
"xd21e2632">99</a>]</span>philosopher, raising his eyes. &ldquo;However
great its desire to better the country, however generous may have been
the spirit of the Catholic kings, the Government sees, hears, judges
nothing more than the curate or the provincial gives it to see, hear,
or judge. The Government is convinced that its tranquillity comes
through the monks; that if it is upheld, it is because they uphold it;
that if it live, is it because they consent to let it, and that the day
when they fail it, it will fall like a manikin that has lost its base.
The monks hold the Government in hand by threatening a revolt of the
people they control; the people, by displaying the power of the
Government. So long as the Government has not an understanding with the
country, it will not free itself from this tutelage. The Government
looks to no vigorous future; it&rsquo;s an arm, the head is the
convent. Through its inertia, it allows itself to be dragged from abyss
to abyss; its existence is no more than a shadow. Compare our system of
government with the systems of countries you have
visited&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted Ibarra,
&ldquo;that is going far. Let us be satisfied that, thanks to religion
and the humanity of our rulers, our people do not complain, do not
suffer like those of other countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The people do not complain because
they have no voice; if they don&rsquo;t revolt, it is because they are
lethargic; if you say they do not suffer, it is because you have not
seen their heart&rsquo;s blood. But the day will come when you will see
and hear. Then woe to those who base their strength on ignorance and
fanaticism; woe to those who govern through falsehood, and work in the
night, thinking that all sleep! When the sun&rsquo;s light shows the
sham of all these phantoms, there will be a frightful reaction; all
this strength conserved for centuries, all this poison distilled drop
by drop, all these sighs strangled, will find the light and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2638" href="#xd21e2638" name=
"xd21e2638">100</a>]</span>air. Who pay these accounts which the people
from time to time present, and which History preserves for us in its
bloody pages?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God will never permit such a day
to come!&rdquo; replied Ibarra, impressed in spite of himself.
&ldquo;The Filipinos are religious, and they love Spain. There are
abuses, yes, but Spain is preparing reforms to correct them; her
projects are now ripening.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I know; but the reforms which come
from the head are annulled lower down, thanks to the greedy desire of
officials to enrich themselves in a short time, and to the ignorance of
the people, who accept everything. Abuses are not to be corrected by
royal decrees, not where the liberty of speech, which permits the
denunciation of petty tyrants, does not exist. Projects remain
projects; abuses, abuses. Moreover, if by chance some one coming to
occupy an office begins to show high and generous ideas, immediately he
hears on all sides&mdash;while to his back he is held a fool:
&lsquo;Your Excellency does not know the country, Your Excellency does
not know the character of the Indians, Your Excellency will ruin them,
Your Excellency will do well to consult this one and that one,&rsquo;
and so forth, and so on. And as in truth His Excellency does not know
the country, which hitherto he had supposed to be in America, and
since, like all men, he has his faults and weaknesses, he allows
himself to be convinced. Don&rsquo;t ask for miracles; don&rsquo;t ask
that he who comes here a stranger to make his fortune should interest
himself in the welfare of the country. What does it mean to him, the
gratitude or the execration of a people he does not know, among whom he
has neither attachments nor hopes? To make glory sweet to us, its
plaudits must resound in the ears of those we love, in the atmosphere
of our home, of the country that is to preserve our ashes; we wish this
glory seated on our tomb, to warm a little with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2644" href="#xd21e2644" name=
"xd21e2644">101</a>]</span>its rays the cold of death, to keep us from
being reduced to nothingness quite. But we wander from the
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is true I did not come to argue
this point; I came to ask advice, and you tell me to bow before
grotesque idols.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, and I repeat it; you must
either lower your head or lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-large">&ldquo;&lsquo;Lower my head or lose
it!&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Ibarra, thoughtful. &ldquo;The dilemma is
hard. Is it impossible to reconcile love of my country and love of
Spain? Must one abase himself to be a good Christian; prostitute his
conscience to achieve a good work? I love my country; I love Spain; I
am a Catholic, and keep pure the faith of my fathers; but I see in all
this no reason for delivering myself into the hands of my
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But the field where you would sow
is in the keeping of your enemies. You must begin by kissing the hand
which&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra did not let him finish.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Kiss their hands! You forget that
among them are those who killed my father and tore his body from the
grave; but I, his son, do not forget, and if I do not avenge, it is
because of my allegiance to religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old philosopher lowered his eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo; he
said slowly, &ldquo;if you are going to keep the remembrance of these
things, things I cannot counsel you to forget, abandon this enterprise
and find some other means of benefiting your compatriots. This work
demands another man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra saw the force of these words, but he could not give up his
project. The remembrance of Maria Clara was in his heart; he must make
good his offering to her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I go on, does your experience
suggest nothing but this hard road?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Old Tasio took his arm and led him to the window. A <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2669" href="#xd21e2669" name=
"xd21e2669">102</a>]</span>fresh breeze was blowing, courier of the
north wind. Below lay the garden.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why must we do as does that
slender stalk, charged with buds and blossoms?&rdquo; said the
philosopher, pointing out a superb rose-tree. &ldquo;The wind makes it
tremble, and it bends, as if to hide its precious charge. If the stalk
stood rigid, it would break, the wind would scatter the flowers, and
the buds would die without opening. The gust of wind passed, the stalk
rises again, proudly wearing her treasure. Who accuses her for having
bowed to necessity? To lower the head when a ball whistles is not
cowardice. What is reprehensible is defying the shot, to fall and rise
no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And will this sacrifice bear the
fruit I seek? Will they have faith in me? Can the priest forget his own
offence? Will they sincerely aid me to spread that instruction which is
sure to dispute with the convents the wealth of the country? Might they
not feign friendship, simulate protection, and, underneath, wound my
enterprise in the heel, that it fall more promptly than if attacked
face to face? Admitting your views, one might expect
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man reflected, then he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If this happens, if the enterprise
fails, you will have the consolation of having done what you could.
Something will have been gained. Your example will embolden others, who
fear only to commence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra weighed these reasonings, examined the situation, and saw
that with all his pessimism the old man was right.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; he said,
grasping his hand. &ldquo;It was not in vain that I came to you for
counsel. I will go straight to the curate, who, after all, may be a
fair-minded man. They are not all like the persecutor of my father. I
go with faith in God and man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took leave of Tasio, mounted, and rode away, followed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2686" href="#xd21e2686" name=
"xd21e2686">103</a>]</span>by the regard of the pessimistic old
philosopher, who stood muttering to himself:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall see, we shall see how the
fates unroll the drama begun in the cemetery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the wise Tasio was wrong; the drama had begun long before.

<h2 class="label">XXII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Meeting at the Town Hall.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was a room of twelve or fifteen by eight or ten
yards. The whitewashed walls were covered with charcoal drawings, more
or less ugly, more or less decent. In the corner were a dozen old
shot-guns and some rusty swords, the arms of the cuadrilleros.</p>
<p>At one end, draped with soiled red curtains, was a portrait of His
Majesty the King, and on the platform underneath an old fauteuil opened
its worn arms; before this was a great table, daubed with ink, carved
and cut with inscriptions and monograms, like the tables of a German
students&rsquo; inn. Lame chairs and tottering benches completed the
furniture.</p>
<p>In this hall meetings were held, courts sat, tortures were
inflicted. At the moment the authorities of the pueblo and its vicinity
were met there. The party of the old did not mingle with the party of
the young; the two represented the Conservatives and Liberals.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; Don Filipo, the
chief of the Liberals, was saying to a little group, &ldquo;we shall
vanquish the old men this time; I&rsquo;m going to present their plan
myself, with exaggerations, you may imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;
demanded his surprised auditors.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Don Filipo.
&ldquo;This morning I ran across old Tasio. He said to me: &lsquo;Your
enemies are more opposed to your person than to your ideas. Is there
something you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2710" href=
"#xd21e2710" name="xd21e2710">105</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t want to have
go through? Propose it yourself. If it&rsquo;s as desirable as a mitre,
they will reject it. Then let the most modest young fellow among you
present what you really want. To humiliate you, your enemies will help
to carry it.&rsquo; Hush! Keep the secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gobernadorcillo had come in. Conversation ceased, all took
places, and silence reigned.</p>
<p>The captain, as the gobernadorcillo is called, sat down in the chair
under the king&rsquo;s portrait. His look was harried. He coughed,
passed his hand over his cranium, coughed again, and at length began in
a failing voice:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores, I&rsquo;ve taken
the risk of convening you all&mdash;hem, hem!&mdash;because we are to
celebrate, the twelfth of this month, the feast of our patron, San
Diego&mdash;hem, hem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point of his discourse a cough, dry and regular, reduced him
to silence.</p>
<p>Then from among the elders arose Captain Basilio:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Will your honors permit me,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;to speak a word under these interesting circumstances?
I speak first, though many of those present have more right than I, but
the things I have to say are of such importance that they should
neither be left aside nor said last, and for that reason I wish to
speak first, to give them the place they merit. Your honors will, then,
permit me to speak first in this assembly, where I see very
distinguished people, like the se&ntilde;or, the present
gobernadorcillo; his predecessor, my distinguished friend, Don
Valentine; his other predecessor, Don Julio; our renowned captain of
the cuadrilleros, Don Melchior, and so many others, whom, for brevity,
I will not mention, and whom you see here present. I entreat your
honors to give me the floor before any one else speaks. Am I happy
enough to have the assembly accede to my humble request?&rdquo; And the
speaker bowed respectfully, half smiling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You may speak, we shall hear you
with pleasure!&rdquo; cried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2727"
href="#xd21e2727" name="xd21e2727">106</a>]</span>his flattering
friends, who held him a great orator. The old men hemmed with
satisfaction and rubbed their hands.</p>
<p>Captain Basilio wiped the sweat from his brow and continued:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Since your honors have been so
kind and complaisant toward my humble self as to grant me the right of
speech before all others here present, I shall profit by this
permission, so generously accorded, and I shall speak. I imagine in my
imagination that I find myself in the midst of the very venerable Roman
senate&mdash;senatus populusque Romanus, as we said in those good old
times which, unhappily for humanity, will never come back,&mdash;and I
will ask the patres conscripti&mdash;as the sage Cicero would say if he
were in my place&mdash;I would ask them, since time presses, and time
is golden as Solomon says, that in this important matter each one give
his opinion clearly, briefly, and simply. I have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And satisfied with himself and with the attention of the house the
orator sat down, not without directing toward his friends a look which
plainly said: &ldquo;Ha! Did I speak well? Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now the floor belongs to any one
who&mdash;hem!&rdquo; said the gobernadorcillo, without being able to
finish his sentence.</p>
<p>To judge by the general silence, no one wished to be one of the
patres conscripti. Don Filipo profited thereby and rose.</p>
<p>The Conservatives looked at one another with significant nods and
gestures.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores, I will present my
project for the f&ecirc;te,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We cannot accept it!&rdquo; said
an uncompromising Conservative.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We vote against it!&rdquo; cried
another adversary.</p>
<p>Don Filipo could not repress a smile. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2750" href="#xd21e2750" name="xd21e2750">107</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We have a budget of 3,500 pesos.
With this sum we can assure a f&ecirc;te that will surpass any we have
yet seen in our own province or in others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were cries of &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Such a pueblo spent
4,000 pesos; another, 5,000!</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen, se&ntilde;ores, and you
will be convinced,&rdquo; continued Don Filipo, unshaken. &ldquo;I
propose that in the middle of the plaza we erect a grand theatre,
costing 150 pesos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Not enough! Say 160!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Observe, gentlemen, 200 pesos for
the theatre. I propose that arrangements be made with the Comedy
Company of Tondo for seven representations, seven consecutive evenings,
at 200 pesos an evening. Seven representations, at 200 pesos each,
makes 1,400 pesos. Observe, se&ntilde;or director, 1,400
pesos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old and young looked at one another in surprise. Only those in the
secret remained unmoved.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I further propose magnificent
fireworks; not those little rockets and crackers that amuse nobody but
children and old maids, but great bombs, colossal rockets. I propose,
then, 200 bombs at two pesos each, and 200 rockets at the same price.
Observe, se&ntilde;ores, 1,000 pesos for bombs
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Conservatives could not contain themselves. They got up and
conferred with one another.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And further, to show our neighbors
that we are not people who must count their expenditures, I propose,
first, four great preachers for the two feast days; second, that each
day we throw into the lake 200 roasted fowls, 100 stuffed capons, and
50 sucking pigs, as did Sylla, contemporary of Cicero, to whom Captain
Basilio alluded.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Like
Sylla!&rdquo; repeated Captain Basilio, flattered.</p>
<p>The astonishment grew. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2774"
href="#xd21e2774" name="xd21e2774">108</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As many rich people will come to
the f&ecirc;tes, each bringing thousands of pesos and his best cocks, I
propose fifteen days of the gallera, the liberty of open gaming
houses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cries rising from all sides drowned his voice; there was a veritable
tumult. The gobernadorcillo, more crushed than ever, did nothing to
quell it; he waited for order to establish itself.</p>
<p>Happily Captain Valentine, most moderate of the Conservatives, rose
and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What the lieutenant proposes seems
to us extravagant. So many bombs and so much comedy could only be
proposed by a young man, like the lieutenant, who could pass all his
evenings at the theatre and hear countless detonations without becoming
deaf. And what of these fowls thrown into the lake? Why should we
imitate Sylla and the Romans? Did they ever invite us to their
f&ecirc;tes? I&rsquo;m an old man, and I&rsquo;ve never received any
summons from them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Romans live at Rome with the
Pope,&rdquo; Captain Basilio whispered.</p>
<p>This did not disconcert Don Valentine.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;the project is inadmissible, impossible; it&rsquo;s a
folly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Filipo must needs retire his project.</p>
<p>Satisfied with the defeat of their enemy, the Conservatives were not
displeased to see another young man rise, the municipal head of a group
of fifty or sixty families, known as a balangay.</p>
<p>He modestly excused himself for speaking. With delicate
blandishments he referred to the &ldquo;ideas so elegantly expressed by
Captain Basilio,&rdquo; upon which the delighted captain made signs to
show him how to gesture and to change position: then he unfolded his
project: to have something absolutely new, and to spend the 3,500 pesos
in such a way as to benefit their own province. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2796" href="#xd21e2796" name=
"xd21e2796">109</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;
interrupted the young men; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what we want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did they care about seeing the King of Bohemia cut off the
heads of his daughters! They were neither kings nor barbarians, and if
they did such things themselves, would be hung high on the field of
Bagumbayan. He proposed that two native plays be given which dealt with
the manners of the times. There were two he had in mind, works of their
best writers. They demanded only native costumes, and could be played
by amateurs of talent, of whom the province had no lack.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A good idea!&rdquo; some of the
Conservatives began to murmur.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for the
theatre!&rdquo; cried Captain Basilio, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Accepted! Accepted!&rdquo; cried
numerous voices. The young man went on:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A part of the money taken at the
theatre might be distributed in prizes: to the best pupil in the
school, the best shepherd, the best fisherman. We might have boat
races, and games, and fireworks, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost all were agreed, though some talked about
&ldquo;innovations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When silence was established, only the decision of the
gobernadorcillo was wanting.</p>
<p>The poor man passed his hand across his forehead, he fidgeted, he
perspired; finally he stammered, lowering his eyes:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I also; I approve; but,
hem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assembly listened in silence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; demanded
Captain Basilio.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I approve entirely,&rdquo;
repeated the functionary, &ldquo;that is to say, I do not approve; I
say yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2826" href="#xd21e2826" name=
"xd21e2826">110</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the unhappy
man, coming to the point at last, &ldquo;the curate wants something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is the curate to pay for the
festival? Has he given even a cuarto?&rdquo; cried a penetrating
voice.</p>
<p>Every one turned. It was Tasio. The lieutenant remained immovable,
his eyes on the gobernadorcillo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what does the curate
want?&rdquo; demanded Don Basilio.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The curate wants six processions,
three sermons, three solemn masses, and if any money is left, a comedy
with songs between the acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want it!&rdquo;
cried the young men and some of their elders.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The curate wishes it,&rdquo;
repeated the gobernadorcillo, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve promised that his
wishes shall be carried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then why did you call us
together?&rdquo; asked one, impatient.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so in the
beginning?&rdquo; demanded another.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I wished to, se&ntilde;ores, but,
Captain Basilio, I did not have a chance. We must obey the
curate!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We must obey!&rdquo; repeated some
of the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Don Filipo approached the gobernadorcillo and said bitterly:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2854" title="Source: sacrified">sacrificed</span> my pride in a
good cause; you sacrifice your manliness in a bad one; you spoil every
good thing that might be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra said to the schoolmaster:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you any commission for the
capital? I leave immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way home the old philosopher said to Don Filipo, who was
cursing his fate:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The fault is ours. You
didn&rsquo;t protest when they gave you a slave for mayor, and I, fool
that I am, forgot about him!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Eve of the F&ecirc;te.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is the 10th of November, the eve of the f&ecirc;te.
The pueblo of San Diego is stirred by an incredible activity; in the
houses, the streets, the church, the gallera, all is unwonted movement.
From windows flags and rugs are hanging; the air, resounding with bombs
and music, seems saturated with gayety. Inside on little tables covered
with bordered cloths the dalaga arranges in jars of tinted crystal the
confitures made from the native fruits. Servants come and go; orders,
whispers, comments, conjectures are everywhere. And all this activity
and labor are for guests as often unknown as known; the stranger, the
friend, the Filipino, the Spaniard, the rich man, the poor man, will be
equally fortunate; and no one will ask his gratitude, nor even demand
that he speak well of his host till the end of his dinner.</p>
<p>The red covers which all the year protect the lamps are taken off,
and the swinging prisms and crystal pendants strike out harmonies from
one another and throw dancing rainbow colors on the white walls. The
glass globes, precious heirlooms, are rubbed and polished; the dainty
handiwork of the young girls of the house is brought out. Floors shine
like mirrors, curtains of pi&ntilde;a or silk jusi ornament the doors,
and in the windows hang lanterns of crystal or of colored paper. The
vases on the Chinese pedestals are heaped with flowers, the saints
themselves in their reliquaries are dusted and wreathed with blossoms.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2876" href="#xd21e2876" name=
"xd21e2876">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>At intervals along the streets rise graceful arches of reed; around
the parvis of the church is the costly covered passageway, supported by
trunks of bamboos, under which the procession is to pass, and in the
centre of the plaza rises the platform of the theatre, with its stage
of reed, of nipa, or of wood. The native pyrotechnician, who learns his
art from no one knows what master, is getting ready his castles,
balloons, and fiery wheels; all the bells of the pueblo are ringing
gaily. There are sounds of music in the distance, and the gamins run to
meet the bands and give them escort. In comes the fanfare with spirited
marches, followed by the ragged and half-naked urchins, who, the moment
a number is ended, know it by heart, hum it, whistle it with wonderful
accuracy, and are ready to pass judgment on it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the people of the mountains, the kasam&agrave;, in gala
dress, bring down to the rich of the pueblo wild game and fruits, and
the rarest plants of the woods, the biga, with its great leaves, and
the tikas-tikas, whose flaming flowers will ornament the doorways of
the houses. And from all sides, in all sorts of vehicles, arrive the
guests, known and unknown, many bringing with them their best cocks and
sacks of gold to risk in the gallera, or on the green cloth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The alf&eacute;rez has fifty pesos
a night,&rdquo; a little plump man is murmuring in the ears of his
guests. &ldquo;Captain Tiago will hold the bank; Captain Joaquin brings
eighteen thousand. There will be liam-p&ocirc;; the Chinese Carlo puts
up the game, with a capital of ten thousand. Sporting men are coming
from Lipa and Batanzos and Santa Cruz. There will be big play! big
play!&mdash;but will you take chocolate?&mdash;Captain Tiago
won&rsquo;t fleece us this year as he did last; and how is your
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Very well, very well, thank you!
And Father D&aacute;maso?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The father will preach in the
morning and be with us at the games in the evening.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2887" href="#xd21e2887" name=
"xd21e2887">113</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of danger
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Without question! Ah, it&rsquo;s
the Chinese who will let their hands go!&rdquo; And in dumb show the
little man counted money with his hands.</p>
<p>But the greatest animation of all was at the outskirts of the crowd,
around a sort of platform a few paces from the home of Ibarra. Pulleys
creaked, cries went up, one heard the metallic ring of stone-cutting,
of nail-driving; a band of workmen were opening a long, deep trench;
others were placing in line great stones from the quarries of the
pueblo, emptying carts, dumping sand, placing capstans.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This way! That&rsquo;s it! Quick
about it!&rdquo; a little old man of intelligent and animated face was
crying. It was the foreman, Se&ntilde;or Juan, architect, mason,
carpenter, metalworker, stonecutter, and on occasions sculptor. To each
stranger he repeated what he had already said a thousand times.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know what we are going to
build? A model school, like those of Germany, and even better. The
plans were traced by Se&ntilde;or R&mdash;&mdash;. I direct the work.
Yes, se&ntilde;or, you see it is to be a palace with two wings, one for
the boys, the other for the girls. Here in the centre will be a great
garden with three fountains, and at the sides little gardens for the
children to cultivate plants. That great space you see there is for
playgrounds. It will be magnificent!&rdquo; And the Se&ntilde;or Juan
rubbed his hands, thinking of his fame to come. Soothed by its
contemplation, he went back and forth, passing everything in
review.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too much wood for a
crane,&rdquo; he said to a Mongol, who was directing a part of the
work. &ldquo;The three beams that make the tripod and the three joining
them would be enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But not for me,&rdquo; replied the
Mongol, with a peculiar smile, &ldquo;the more ornament, the more
imposing the effect. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2903" href=
"#xd21e2903" name="xd21e2903">114</a>]</span>You will see! I shall trim
it, too, with wreaths and streamers. You will say in the end that you
were right to give the work into my hands, and Se&ntilde;or Ibarra will
have nothing left to desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled still, and Se&ntilde;or Juan laughed and threw back
his head.</p>
<p>In truth, Ibarra&rsquo;s project had found an echo almost
everywhere. The curate had asked to be a patron and to bless the
cornerstone, a ceremony that was to take place the last day of the
f&ecirc;te, and to be one of its chief solemnities. One of the most
conservative papers of Manila had dedicated to Ibarra on its first page
an article entitled, &ldquo;Imitate Him!&rdquo; He was therein called
&ldquo;the young and rich capitalist, already a marked man,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the distinguished philanthropist,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Spanish
Filipino,&rdquo; and so forth. The students who had come from Manila
for the f&ecirc;te were full of admiration for Ibarra, and ready to
take him for their model. But, as almost always when we try to imitate
a man who towers above the crowd, we ape his weaknesses, if not his
faults, many of these admirers of Cris&oacute;stomo&rsquo;s held
rigorously to the tie of his cravat, or the shape of his collar; almost
all to the number of buttons on his vest. Even Captain Tiago burned
with generous emulation, and asked himself if he ought not to build a
convent.</p>
<p>The dark presentiments of old Tasio seemed dissipated. When Ibarra
said so to him, the old pessimist replied: &ldquo;<span lang="la">Timeo
Danaos et dona ferentes</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toward evening Captain Tiago arrived from Manila, bringing Maria
Clara, in honor of the f&ecirc;te, a beautiful reliquary of gold, set
with emeralds and diamonds, enshrining a splinter from the fishing-boat
of St. Peter. Scarcely had he come when a party of Maria&rsquo;s
friends came to take her out to see the streets.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said Captain Tiago,
&ldquo;but come back soon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2918"
href="#xd21e2918" name="xd21e2918">115</a>]</span>Father D&aacute;maso,
you know, is to dine with us. You, too, Cris&oacute;stomo, must join
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure,&rdquo;
stammered Ibarra, avoiding Maria Clara&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;if I did
not feel that I must be at home to receive whoever may come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bring your friends here; there is
always room at my table,&rdquo; said Captain Tiago, somewhat coldly.
&ldquo;I wish Father D&aacute;maso and you to come to an
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There is yet time,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>As they descended to the street, Aunt Isabel following, people moved
aside to let them pass. Maria Clara was a vision of loveliness: her
pallor had disappeared, and if her eyes remained pensive, her mouth
seemed to know only smiles. With the amiability characteristic of happy
young womanhood she saluted the people she had known as a child, and
they smiled back their admiration. In these few days of freedom she had
regained the frank friendliness, the gracious speech, which seemed to
have slumbered inside the narrow walls of her convent. She felt a new,
intense life within her, and everything without seemed good and
beautiful. She showed her love for Ibarra with that maiden sweetness
which comes from pure thoughts and knows no reason for false
blushes.</p>
<p>At regular intervals in the streets were kindled great clustered
lights with bamboo supports, like candelabra. People were beginning to
illuminate their houses, and through the open windows one could see the
guests moving about in the radiance among the flowers to the music of
harp, piano, or orchestra. Outside, in gala costume, native or
European, Chinese, Spaniards, and Filipinos were moving in all
directions, escaping with difficulty the crush of carriages and
calashes.</p>
<p>When the party reached Captain Basilio&rsquo;s house, Sinang saw
them, and ran down the steps. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2933"
href="#xd21e2933" name="xd21e2933">116</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come up till I&rsquo;m ready to go
out with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m weary of all these
strangers who talk of nothing but cocks and cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house was full of people. Many came up to greet
Cris&oacute;stomo, and all admired Maria Clara. &ldquo;Beautiful as the
Virgin!&rdquo; the old dames whispered, chewing their buyo.</p>
<p>Here they must take chocolate. As they were leaving, Captain Basilio
said in Ibarra&rsquo;s ear:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you join us this
evening? Father D&aacute;maso is going to make up a little
purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra smiled and answered by a movement of the head, which might
have meant anything.</p>
<p>Chatting and laughing, the merry party went on past the brilliantly
illuminated houses. At length they came to one fast closed and dark. It
was the home of the alf&eacute;rez. Maria was astonished.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that old sorceress. The
Muse of the Municipal Guard, as Tasio calls her,&rdquo; said Sinang.
&ldquo;Her house is in mourning because the people are gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a corner of the plaza, where a blind man was singing, an uncommon
sight offered itself. A man stood there, miserably dressed, his head
covered by a great salakot of palm leaves, which completely hid his
face, though from its shadow two lights gleamed and went out fitfully.
He was tall, and, from his figure, young. He pushed forward a basket,
and after speaking some unintelligible words drew back and stood
completely isolated. Women passing put fruit and rice into his basket,
and at this he came forward a little, speaking what seemed to be his
thanks.</p>
<p>Maria Clara felt the presence of some great suffering. &ldquo;Who is
it?&rdquo; she asked Iday.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a leper. He lives
outside the pueblo, near the Chinese cemetery; every one fears to go
near him. If you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2955" href=
"#xd21e2955" name="xd21e2955">117</a>]</span>could see his cabin! The
wind, the rain, and the sun must visit him as they like.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; murmured Maria
Clara, and hardly knowing what she did, she went up and put into the
basket the reliquary her father had just given her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria!&rdquo; exclaimed her
friends.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I had nothing else,&rdquo; she
said, forcing back the tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What will he do with the
reliquary? He can&rsquo;t sell it! Nobody will touch it now! If only it
could be eaten!&rdquo; said Sinang.</p>
<p>But the leper went to the basket, took the glittering thing in his
hands, fell on his knees, kissed it, and bent his head to the ground,
uncovering humbly. Maria Clara turned her face to hide the tears.</p>
<p>As the leper knelt, a woman crept up and knelt beside him. By her
long, loose hair and emaciated face the people recognized Sisa. The
leper, feeling her touch, sprang up with a cry; but, to the horror of
the crowd, she clung to his arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pray! Pray!&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;It is the Feast of the Dead! These lights are the souls of men.
Pray for my sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Separate them! Separate
them!&rdquo; cried the crowd; but no one dared do it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you see the light in the tower?
That is my son Basilio, ringing the bells. Do you see that other in the
manse? That is my son Crispin; but I cannot go to them, because the
curate is ill, and his money is lost. I carried the curate fruit from
my garden. My garden was full of flowers, and I had two sons. I had a
garden, I tended my flowers, and I had two sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And leaving the leper she moved away, singing:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I had a garden and flowers. I had
two sons, a garden and flowers.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2980" href="#xd21e2980" name="xd21e2980">118</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What have you done for that poor
woman?&rdquo; Maria asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nothing yet,&rdquo; he replied,
somewhat confused. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be troubled; the curate has
promised to aid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they spoke, a soldier came dragging Sisa back, rather than
leading her. She was resisting.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where are you taking her? What has
she done?&rdquo; asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What has she done? Didn&rsquo;t
you hear the noise she made?&rdquo; said the guardian of public
tranquillity.</p>
<p>The leper took up his basket and vanished. Maria Clara asked to go
home. She had lost all her gayety. Her sadness increased when, arrived
at her door, her fianc&eacute; refused to go in.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It must be so to-night,&rdquo; he
said as he bade her good-by.</p>
<p>Maria, mounting the steps, thought how tiresome were f&ecirc;te
days, when one must receive so many strangers.</p>
<p>The next evening a little perfumed note came to Ibarra by the hand
of Andeng, Maria&rsquo;s foster sister.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cris&oacute;stomo, for a
whole day I have not seen you. They tell me you are ill. I have lighted
two candles and prayed for you. I&rsquo;m so tired of being asked to
play and dance. I did not know there were so many tiresome people in
the world. If Father D&aacute;maso had not tried to amuse me with
stories, I should have left them all and gone away to sleep. Write me
how you are, and if I shall send papa to see you. I send you Andeng now
to make your tea; she will do it better than your servants. If you
don&rsquo;t come to-morrow, I shall not go to the ceremony.</p>

<h2 class="main">In the Church.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The orchestras sounded the reveille at the first rays
of the sun, waking with joyous airs the tired inhabitants of the
pueblo.</p>
<p>It was the last day of the f&ecirc;te&mdash;indeed, the f&ecirc;te
itself. Every one expected much more than on the eve, when the Brothers
of the Sacred Rosary had had their sermon and procession; for the
Brothers of the Third Order were more numerous, and counted on
humiliating their rivals. The Chinese candle merchants had reaped a
rich harvest.</p>
<p>Everybody put on his gala dress; all the jewels came out of their
coffers; the fops and sporting men wore rows of diamond buttons on
their shirt fronts, heavy gold chains, and white jipijapa hats, as the
Indians call Panamas. No one but old Tasio was in everyday costume.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You seem even sadder than
usual,&rdquo; the lieutenant said to him. &ldquo;Because we have so
many reasons to weep, may we not laugh once in a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, laugh, but not play the fool!
It&rsquo;s the same insane orgy every year, the same waste of money
when there&rsquo;s so much need and so much suffering! But I see!
It&rsquo;s the orgy, the bacchanal, that is to still the lamentations
of the poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know I share your
opinion,&rdquo; said Don Filipo, half serious, half laughing,
&ldquo;and that I defended it; but what can I do against the
gobernadorcillo and the curate?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; cries the irate old
man, leaving him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3028" href=
"#xd21e3028" name="xd21e3028">120</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; muttered Don
Filipo, going on toward the church. &ldquo;Resign? Yes, certainly, if
my post were an honor and not a charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a crowd in the parvis, and men, women, and children in a
stream were coming and going through the narrow doors of the church.
The smell of powder mingled with that of flowers and incense. Rockets,
bombs, and serpents made women run and scream and delighted the
children. An orchestra was playing before the convent; bands
accompanied dignitaries on their way to the church, or paraded the
streets under innumerable floating and dipping flags. Light and color
distracted the eye, music and explosions the ear.</p>
<p>High mass was about to be celebrated. Among the congregation were to
be the chief alcalde of the province and other Spanish notables; and
last, the sermon would be given by Brother D&aacute;maso, who had the
greatest renown as a preacher.</p>
<p>The church was crammed. People were jostled, crushed, trampled on,
and cried out at each encounter. From far they stretched their arms to
dip their fingers in the holy water, but getting nearer, saw its color,
and the hands retired. They scarcely breathed; the heat and atmosphere
were insupportable; but the preacher was worth the endurance of all
these miseries; besides, his sermon was to cost the pueblo two hundred
and fifty pesos. Fans, hats, and handkerchiefs agitated the air;
children cried, and gave the sacristans a hard enough task getting them
out.</p>
<p>Ibarra was in a corner. Maria Clara knelt near the high altar, where
the curate had reserved a place for her. Captain Tiago, in frock coat,
sat on the bench of authorities, and the children, who did not know
him, taking him for another gobernadorcillo, dared not go near him.</p>
<p>At length the alcalde arrived with his suite. He came <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3042" href="#xd21e3042" name=
"xd21e3042">121</a>]</span>from the sacristy, and sat down in a
splendid fauteuil, beneath which was spread a rich carpet. He was in
full dress, and wore the cordon of Charles III., with four or five
other decorations.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried a countryman.
&ldquo;A citizen in fancy dress!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Imbecile!&rdquo; replied his
neighbor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Prince Villardo whom we saw last night in
the play!&rdquo; And the alcalde, in the character of giant-slayer,
rose accordingly in the popular estimation.</p>
<p>Presently those seated arose, those sleeping awoke, the mass had
begun. Brother Salvi celebrated, attended by two Augustins. At length
came the long-looked-for moment of the sermon. The three priests sat
down, the alcalde and other notables followed them, the music ceased.
The people made themselves as comfortable as possible, those who had no
benches sitting outright on the pavement, or arranging themselves
tailor fashion.</p>
<p>Preceded by two sacristans and followed by another monk, who bore a
great book, Father D&aacute;maso made his way through the crowd. He
disappeared a moment in the spiral staircase of the pulpit, then his
great head reappeared and his herculean bust. He looked over his
audience, and, the review terminated, said to his companion, hidden at
his feet:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Attention, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monk opened his book. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3056"

<h2 class="label">XXV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Sermon.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first part of the sermon was to be in Castilian,
the remainder in Tagalo. Brother D&aacute;maso began slowly and in
ordinary voice:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<i lang="la">Et spiritum tuum
bonum dedisti qui docevet eos, et manna tuum non prohibuisti ab ore
eorum, et aquam dedisti eis in siti.</i> Words of the Lord spoken by
the mouth of Esdras, Book II., chapter ix., verse 20.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Most worshipful se&ntilde;or (to
the alcalde), very reverend priests, brothers in Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here an impressive pose and a new glance round the audience, then,
his eyes on the alcalde, the father majestically extended his right
hand toward the altar, slowly crossed his arms, without saying a word,
and, passing from this calm to action, threw back his head, pointed
toward the main entrance, and, impetuously cutting the air with the
edge of his hand, began to speak in a voice strong, full, and
resonant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Brilliant and splendid is the
altar, wide the door, the air is the vehicle of the sacred word which
shall spring from my lips. Hear, then, with the ears of the soul and
the heart, that the words of the Lord may not fall on a stony ground,
but that they may grow and shoot upward in the field of our seraphic
father, St. Francis. You, sinners, captives of those Moors of the soul
who infest the seas of the eternal life, in the doughty ships of the
flesh and the world; you who row in the galleys of Satan, behold with
reverent compunction him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3075" href=
"#xd21e3075" name="xd21e3075">123</a>]</span>who redeems souls from the
captivity of the demon&mdash;the intrepid Gideon, the courageous David,
the victorious Roland of Christianity! the celestial guard, more
valiant than all the civil guards of past and future. (The
alf&eacute;rez frowned.) Yes, Se&ntilde;or Alf&eacute;rez, more valiant
and more powerful than all! This conqueror, who, without other weapon
than a wooden cross, vanquished the eternal tulisanes of darkness, and
would have utterly destroyed them were spirits not immortal. This
marvel, this incredible phenomenon, is the blessed Diego of
Alcala!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;rude Indians,&rdquo; as the correspondents say, fished
out of this paragraph only the words civil guard, tulisane, San Diego,
and San Francisco. They had noticed the grimace of the alf&eacute;rez
and the militant gesture of the preacher, and had from this deduced
that the father was angry with the guard for not pursuing the
tulisanes, and that San Diego and San Francisco had taken upon
themselves to do it. They were enchanted, not doubting that, the
tulisanes once dispersed, St. Francis would also destroy the municipal
guard. Their attention, therefore, redoubled.</p>
<p>The monk continued so long his eulogy of San Diego that his
auditors, not even excepting Captain Tiago, began to yawn a little.
Then he reproached them with living like the Protestants and heretics,
who respect not the ministers of God; like the Chinese, for which
condemnation be upon them!</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is he telling us, the
Pal&eacute; L&aacute;maso?&rdquo; murmured the Chinese Carlos, looking
angrily at the preacher, who went on improvising a series of
apostrophes and imprecations.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will die in impenitence, race
of heretics! Your punishment is already being meted out to you in jails
and prisons. The family and its women should flee you; rulers should
destroy you. If you have a member that causeth you to offend, cut it
off and cast it into the fire!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3085" href="#xd21e3085" name="xd21e3085">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>Brother D&aacute;maso was nervous. He had forgotten his sermon and
was improvising. Ibarra became restless; he looked about in search of
some corner, but the church was full. Maria Clara no longer heard the
sermon. She was analyzing a picture of the souls of the &ldquo;Blessed
in Purgatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the improvisation the monk who played the part of prompter lost
his place and skipped some paragraphs. The text returned to San Diego,
and with a long series of exclamations and contrasts the father brought
to a close the first part of his sermon.</p>
<p>The second part was entirely improvised; not that Brother
D&aacute;maso knew Tagalo better than Castilian; but, considering the
natives of the province entirely ignorant of rhetoric, he did not mind
making errors before them. Yet the second part of his discourse had for
certain people graver consequences than the first.</p>
<p>He began with a &ldquo;Man&aacute; capatir concristians,&rdquo;
&ldquo;My Christian brothers,&rdquo; followed by an avalanche of
untranslatable phrases about the soul, sin, and the patron saint. Then
he launched a new series of maledictions against lack of respect and
growing irreligion. On this point he seemed to be inspired, and
expressed himself with force and clearness. He spoke of sinners who die
in prison without confession or the sacraments; of accursed families,
of petty students, and of toy philosophers.</p>
<p>Ibarra listened and understood. He kept a calm exterior, but his
eyes turned toward the bench of magistrates. No one seemed to pay
attention; as to the alcalde, he was asleep.</p>
<p>The inspiration of the preacher increased. He spoke of the early
times when every Filipino encountering a priest uncovered, knelt, and
kissed his hand. Now, he said, there were those who, because they had
studied in Manila or in Europe, thought fit to shake the hand of a
priest instead of kissing it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3099"
href="#xd21e3099" name="xd21e3099">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>But in spite of the cries and gestures of the orator, by this time
many of his auditors slept, and few listened. Some of the devout would
have wept over the sins of the ungodly, but nobody joined them, and
they were forced to give it up. A man seated beside an old woman went
so sound asleep that he fell over against her. The good woman took her
slipper and tried to waken him, at the same time crying out:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Get away! Savage, animal, demon,
carabao!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally this raised a tumult. The preacher elevated his brows,
struck dumb by such a scandal; indignation strangled the words in his
throat; he could only strike the pulpit with his fists. This had its
effect. The old woman dropped the shoe and, still grumbling and signing
herself, sank on her knees.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, ah, ah, ah!&rdquo; the irate
priest could at last articulate. &ldquo;It is for this that I have
preached to you all the morning! Savages! You respect nothing! Behold
the work of the incontinence of the century!&rdquo; And launched again
upon this theme, he preached a half hour longer. The alcalde breathed
loud. Maria Clara, having studied all the pictures in sight, had
dropped her head. Cris&oacute;stomo had ceased to be moved by the
sermon. He was picturing a little house, high up among the mountains,
with Maria Clara in the garden. Why concern himself with men, dragging
out their lives in the miserable pueblos of the valley?</p>
<p>At length the sermon ended, and the mass went on. At the moment when
all were kneeling and the priests bowed their heads at the
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Incarnatus est</span>,&rdquo; a man murmured in
Ibarra&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;At the blessing of the cornerstone do not
separate yourself from the curate; do not go down into the trench. Your
life is at stake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the helmsman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3116" href=

<h2 class="label">XXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Crane.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was indeed not an ordinary crane that the Mongol
had built for letting the enormous cornerstone of the school into the
trench. The framework was complicated and the cables passed over
extraordinary pulleys. Flags, streamers, and garlands of flowers,
however, hid the mechanism. By means of a cleverly contrived capstan,
the enormous stone held suspended over the open trench could be raised
or lowered with ease by a single man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said the Mongol to
Se&ntilde;or Juan, inserting the bar and turning it. &ldquo;See how I
can manipulate the thing up here and unaided!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Juan was full of admiration.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who taught you mechanics?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My father, my late father,&rdquo;
replied the man, with his peculiar smile, &ldquo;and Don Saturnino, the
grandfather of Don Cris&oacute;stomo, taught him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You must know then about Don
Saturnino&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, many things! Not only did he
beat his workmen and expose them to the sun, but he knew how to awaken
sleepers and put waking men to sleep. Ah, you will see presently what
he could teach! You will see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a table with Persian spread, beside the trench, were the things
to be put into the cornerstone, and the glass box and leaden cylinder
which were to preserve for the future these souvenirs, this mummy of an
epoch.</p>
<p>Under two long booths near at hand were sumptuous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3140" href="#xd21e3140" name=
"xd21e3140">127</a>]</span>tables, one for the school-children, without
wine, and heaped with fruits; the other for the distinguished visitors.
The booths were joined by a sort of bower of leafy branches, where were
chairs for the musicians, and tables with cakes, confitures, and
carafes of water, for the public in general.</p>
<p>The crowd, gay in garments of many colors, was massed under the
trees to avoid the ardent rays of the sun, and the children, to better
see the ceremony of the dedication, had climbed up among the
branches.</p>
<p>Soon bands were heard in the distance. The Mongol carefully examined
his construction; he seemed nervous. A man with the appearance of a
peasant standing near him on the edge of the excavation and close
beside the capstan watched all his movements. It was Elias, well
disguised by his salakot and rustic costume.</p>
<p>The musicians arrived, preceded by a crowd of old and young in
motley array. Behind came the alcalde, the municipal guard officers,
the monks, and the Spanish Government clerks. Ibarra was talking with
the alcalde; Captain Tiago, the alf&eacute;rez, the curate and a number
of the rich country gentlemen accompanied the ladies, whose gay
parasols gleamed in the sunshine.</p>
<p>As they approached the trench, Ibarra felt his heart beat.
Instinctively he raised his eyes to the strange scaffolding. The Mongol
saluted him respectfully, and looked at him intently a moment. Ibarra
recognized Elias through his disguise, and the mysterious helmsman, by
a significant glance, recalled the warning in the church.</p>
<p>The curate put on his robes and began the office. The one-eyed
sacristan held his book; a choir boy had in charge the holy water and
sprinkler. The men uncovered, and the crowd stood so silent that,
though the father read low, his voice was heard to tremble.</p>
<p>The manuscripts, journals, money, and medals to be preserved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3155" href="#xd21e3155" name=
"xd21e3155">128</a>]</span>in remembrance of this day had been placed
in the glass box and the box itself hermetically sealed within the
leaden cylinder.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, will you
place the box in the stone? The curate is waiting for you,&rdquo; said
the alcalde in Ibarra&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I should do so with great
pleasure,&rdquo; said Ibarra, &ldquo;but it would be a usurpation of
the honor; that belongs to the notary, who must draw up the written
process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notary gravely took the box, descended the carpeted stairway
which led to the bottom of the trench, and with due solemnity deposited
his burden in the hollow of the stone already laid. The curate took the
sprinkler and sprinkled the stone with holy water.</p>
<p>Each one was now to deposit his trowel of cement on the surface of
the lower stone, to seal it to the stone held suspended by the crane
when that should be lowered.</p>
<p>Ibarra offered the alcalde a silver trowel, on which was engraved
the date of the f&ecirc;te, but before using it His Excellency
pronounced a short allocution in Castilian.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Citizens of San Diego,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;we have the honor of presiding at a ceremony whose
importance you know without explanations. We are founding a school, and
the school is the basis of society, the book wherein is written the
future of each race.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Citizens of San Diego! Thank God,
who has given you these priests! Thank the Mother Country, who spreads
civilization in these fertile isles and protects them with the covering
of her glorious mantle. Thank God, again, who has enlightened you by
his priests from his divine Word.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And now that the first stone of
this building has been blessed, we, the alcalde of this province, in
the name of His Majesty the King, whom God guard; in the name of the
illustrious Spanish Government, and under the protection <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3174" href="#xd21e3174" name=
"xd21e3174">129</a>]</span>of its spotless and ever-victorious flag,
consecrate this act and begin the building of this school!</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Citizens of San Diego, long live
the king! Long live Spain! Long live the religious orders! Long live
the Catholic church!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Long live the Se&ntilde;or
Alcalde!&rdquo; replied many voices.</p>
<p>Then the high official descended majestically, to the strains of the
orchestras, put his trowel of cement on the stone, and came back as
majestically as he had gone down.</p>
<p>The Government clerks applauded.</p>
<p>Ibarra offered the trowel to the curate, who descended slowly in his
turn. In the middle of the staircase he raised his eyes to the great
stone suspended above, but he stopped only a second, and continued the
descent. This time the applause was a little warmer, Captain Tiago and
the monks adding theirs to that of the clerks.</p>
<p>The notary followed. He gallantly offered the trowel to Maria Clara,
but she refused, with a smile. The monks, the alf&eacute;rez, and
others descended in turn, Captain Tiago not being forgotten.</p>
<p>Ibarra was left. He had ordered the stone to be lowered when the
curate remembered him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You do not put on your trowelful,
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra?&rdquo; said the curate, with a familiar and
jocular air.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I should be Juan Palomo, who made
the soup and then ate it,&rdquo; replied Cris&oacute;stomo in the same
light tone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You go down, of course,&rdquo;
said the alcalde, taking him by the arm in friendly fashion. &ldquo;If
not, I shall order that the stone be kept suspended, and we shall stay
here till the Day of Judgment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a menace forced Ibarra to obey. He exchanged the silver trowel
for a larger one of iron, as some people noticed, and started out
calmly. Elias gave him an indefinable <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3199" href="#xd21e3199" name="xd21e3199">130</a>]</span>look; his
whole being seemed in it. The Mongol&rsquo;s eyes were on the abyss at
his feet.</p>
<p>Ibarra, after glancing rapidly at the block over his head, at Elias,
and at the Mongol, said to Se&ntilde;or Juan, in a voice that
trembled:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Give me the tray and bring me the
other trowel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood alone. Elias no longer looked at him, his eyes were riveted
on the hands of the Mongol, who, bending over, was anxiously following
the movements of Ibarra. Then the sound of Ibarra&rsquo;s trowel was
heard, accompanied by the low murmur of the clerks&rsquo; voices as
they felicitated the alcalde on his speech.</p>
<p>Suddenly a frightful noise rent the air. A pulley attached to the
base of the crane sprang out, dragging after it the capstan, which
struck the crane like a lever. The beams tottered, the cables broke,
and the whole fabric collapsed with a deafening roar and in a whirlwind
of dust.</p>
<p>A thousand voices filled the place with cries of horror. People fled
in all directions. Only Maria Clara and Brother Salvi remained where
they were, pale, mute, incapable of motion.</p>
<p>As the cloud of dust thinned, Ibarra was seen upright among the
beams, joists and cables, between the capstan and the great stone that
had fallen. He still held the trowel in his hand. With eyes frightful
to look at, he regarded a corpse half buried under the beams at his
feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you unhurt? Are you alive? For
God&rsquo;s sake, speak!&rdquo; cried some one at last.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A miracle! A miracle!&rdquo; cried
others.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come, take out the body of this
man,&rdquo; said Ibarra, as if waking from a dream. At the sound of his
voice Maria Clara would have fallen but for the arms of her
friends.</p>
<p>Then everything was confusion. All talked at once, gestured, went
hither and thither, and knew not what to do. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3222" href="#xd21e3222" name=
"xd21e3222">131</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who is killed?&rdquo; demanded the
alf&eacute;rez.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Arrest the head builder!&rdquo;
were the first words the alcalde could pronounce.</p>
<p>They brought up the body and examined it. It was that of the Mongol.
The heart no longer beat.</p>
<p>The priests shook Ibarra&rsquo;s hand, and warmly congratulated
him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When I think that I was there a
moment before!&rdquo; said one of the clerks.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is well they gave the trowel to
you instead of me,&rdquo; said a trembling old man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Pascal!&rdquo; cried some of
the Spaniards.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores, the Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra lives, while I, if I had not been crushed, should have died of
fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra had been to inform himself of Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let the f&ecirc;te continue,
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo; said the alcalde, as he came back.
&ldquo;Thank God, the dead is neither priest nor Spaniard! You ought to
celebrate your escape! What if the stone had fallen on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He had presentiments!&rdquo; cried
the notary. &ldquo;He did not want to go down, that was plain to be
seen!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only an
Indian!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let the f&ecirc;te go on! Give us
music! Mourning won&rsquo;t raise the dead. Captain, let the inquest be
held! Arrest the head builder!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Shall he be put in the
stocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, in the stocks! Music, music!
The head builder in the stocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, &ldquo;if mourning won&rsquo;t raise the dead, neither will the
imprisonment of a man whose guilt is not proven. I go security for his
person and ask his liberty, for these f&ecirc;te days at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Very well! But let him not repeat
it!&rdquo; said the alcalde. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3258"
href="#xd21e3258" name="xd21e3258">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>All kinds of rumors circulated among the people. The idea of a
miracle was generally accepted. Many said they had seen descend into
the trench at the fatal moment a figure in a dark costume, like that of
the Franciscans. &rsquo;Twas no doubt San Diego himself.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A bad beginning,&rdquo; muttered
old Tasio, shaking his head as he moved away. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Free Thought.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ibarra, who had gone home for a change of clothing,
had just finished dressing when a servant announced that a peasant
wished to see him. Supposing it to be one of his laborers, he had him
taken to his work room, which was at the same time his library and
chemical laboratory. To his great surprise he found himself face to
face with the mysterious Elias.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You saved my life,&rdquo; said the
man, speaking in Tagalo, and understanding the movement of Ibarra.
&ldquo;I have not half paid my debt. Do not thank me. It is I who
should thank you. I have come to ask a favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; said his
listener.</p>
<p>Elias fixed his melancholy eyes on Ibarra&rsquo;s and went on:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When the justice of man tries to
clear up this mystery, and your testimony is taken, I entreat you not
to speak to any one of the warning I gave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not be alarmed,&rdquo; said
Cris&oacute;stomo, losing interest; &ldquo;I know you are pursued, but
I&rsquo;m not an informer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak for myself,
but for you,&rdquo; said Elias, with some haughtiness. &ldquo;I have no
fear of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra grew surprised. This manner of speaking was new, and did not
comport with the state or fortunes of the helmsman.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Explain yourself!&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am not speaking enigmas. To
insure your safety, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3290" href=
"#xd21e3290" name="xd21e3290">134</a>]</span>is necessary that your
enemies believe you blind and confiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To insure my safety?&rdquo; said
Ibarra, thoroughly aroused.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You undertake a great
enterprise,&rdquo; Elias went on. &ldquo;You have a past. Your
grandfather and your father had enemies. It is not criminals who
provoke the most hatred; it is honorable men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know my enemies,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias hesitated.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I knew one; the dead
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I regret his death,&rdquo; said
Ibarra; &ldquo;from him I might have learned more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Had he lived, he would have
escaped the trembling hand of men&rsquo;s justice. God has judged
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you also believe in the miracle
of which the people talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I believed in such a miracle, I
should not believe in God, and I believe in Him; I have more than once
felt His hand. At the moment when the scaffolding gave way I placed
myself beside the criminal.&rdquo; Elias looked at Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You&mdash;you mean that
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, when his deadly work was
about to be done, he was going to flee; I held him there; I had seen
his crime! Let God be the only one who has the right over
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And yet, this time
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Elias. &ldquo;I
exposed the criminal to the risk he had prepared for others; I ran the
risk myself; and I did not strike him; I left him to be struck by the
hand of God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra regarded the man in silence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are not a peasant,&rdquo; he
said at last. &ldquo;Who are you? Have you studied?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve need of much belief in
God, since I&rsquo;ve lost faith in men,&rdquo; said Elias, evading the
question. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3325" href="#xd21e3325"
name="xd21e3325">135</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But God cannot speak to resolve
each of the countless contests our passions raise; it is necessary, it
is just, that man should sometimes judge his kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For good, yes; not for evil. To
correct and ameliorate, not to destroy; because, if man&rsquo;s
judgments are erroneous, he has not the power to remedy the evil he has
done. But this discussion is over my head, and I am detaining you. Do
not forget what I came to entreat; save yourself for the good of your
country!&rdquo; And he started to go.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And when shall I see you
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Whenever you wish; whenever I can
be of use to you; I am always your debtor!&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">XXVIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Banquet.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All the distinguished people of the province were
united in the carpeted and decorated booth. The alcalde was at one end
of the table, Ibarra at the other. The talk was animated, even gay. The
meal was half finished when a despatch was handed to Captain Tiago. He
asked permission to read it; his face paled; then lighted up.
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; he cried, quite beside himself,
&ldquo;His Excellency the captain-general is to honor my house with his
presence!&rdquo; And he started off running, carrying his despatch and
his napkin, forgetting his hat, and pursued by exclamations and
questions. The announcement of the tulisanes could not have put him to
greater confusion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Wait a moment! When is he coming?
Tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Tiago was already in the distance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;His Excellency asks the
hospitality of Captain Tiago!&rdquo; the guests exclaimed, apparently
forgetting that they spoke before his daughter and his future
son-in-law.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He could hardly make a better
choice,&rdquo; said Ibarra, with dignity.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This was spoken of
yesterday,&rdquo; said the alcalde, &ldquo;but His Excellency had not
fully decided.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know how long he is to
stay?&rdquo; asked the alf&eacute;rez, uneasily.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure! His
Excellency is fond of surprising people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three other despatches were brought. They were for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3358" href="#xd21e3358" name=
"xd21e3358">137</a>]</span>alcalde, the alf&eacute;rez, and the
gobernadorcillo, and identical, announcing the coming of the governor.
It was remarked that there was none for the curate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;His Excellency arrives at four
this afternoon,&rdquo; said the alcalde, solemnly. &ldquo;We can finish
our repast.&rdquo; It might have been Leonidas saying: &ldquo;To-night
we sup with Pluto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation returned to its former course.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I notice the absence of our great
preacher,&rdquo; said one of the clerks, an honest, inoffensive fellow,
who had not yet said a word. Those who knew the story of Ibarra&rsquo;s
father looked significantly at one another. &ldquo;Fools rush
in,&rdquo; said the glances of some; but others, more considerate,
tried to cover the error.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He must be somewhat
fatigued&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Somewhat!&rdquo; cried the
alf&eacute;rez. &ldquo;He must be spent, as they say here, malunqueado.
What a sermon!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Superb! Herculean!&rdquo; was the
opinion of the notary.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Magnificent! Profound!&rdquo; said
a newspaper correspondent.</p>
<p>In the other booth the children were more noisy than little
Filipinos are wont to be, for at table or before strangers they are
usually rather too timid than too bold. If one of them did not eat with
propriety, his neighbor corrected him. To one a certain article was a
spoon; to others a fork or a knife; and as nobody settled their
questions, they were in continual uproar.</p>
<p>Their fathers and mothers, simple peasants, looked in ravishment to
see their children eating on a white cloth, and doing it almost as well
as the curate or the alcalde. It was better to them than a banquet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a young peasant
woman to an old man grinding his buyo, &ldquo;whatever my husband says,
my Andoy shall be a priest. It is true, we are poor; but Father Mateo
says Pope Sixtu was once a keeper of carabaos at Batanzas! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3381" href="#xd21e3381" name=
"xd21e3381">138</a>]</span>Look at my Andoy; hasn&rsquo;t he a face
like St. Vincent?&rdquo; and the good mother&rsquo;s mouth watered at
the sight of her son with his fork in both hands!</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; said the old
man, munching his sapa. &ldquo;If Andoy gets to be pope, we will go to
Rome! I can walk yet! Ho! Ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another peasant came up.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s decided,
neighbor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my son is to be a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A doctor! Don&rsquo;t speak of
it!&rdquo; replied Petra. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like being a
curate! He has only to make two or three turns and say
&lsquo;d&eacute;minos pabiscum&rsquo; and he gets his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it work to
confess?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Work! Think of the trouble we take
to find out the affairs of our neighbors! The curate has only to sit
down, and they tell him everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And preaching? Don&rsquo;t you
call that work?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Preaching? Where is your head? To
scold half a day from the pulpit without any one&rsquo;s daring to
reply and be paid for it into the bargain! Look, look at Father
D&aacute;maso! See how fat he gets with his shouting and
pounding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth, Father D&aacute;maso was that moment passing the
children&rsquo;s booth in the gait peculiar to men of his size. As he
entered the other booth, he was half smiling, but so maliciously that
at sight of it Ibarra, who was talking, lost the thread of his
speech.</p>
<p>The guests were astonished to see the father, but every one except
Ibarra received him with signs of pleasure. They were at the dessert,
and the champagne was sparkling in the cups.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso&rsquo;s smile became nervous when he saw Maria
Clara sitting next Cris&oacute;stomo, but, taking a chair beside the
alcalde, he said in the midst of a significant silence: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3406" href="#xd21e3406" name=
"xd21e3406">139</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You were talking of something,
se&ntilde;ores; continue!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We had come to the toasts,&rdquo;
said the alcalde. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra was mentioning those who
had aided him in his philanthropic enterprise, and he was speaking of
the architect when your reverence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, well! I know nothing about
architecture,&rdquo; interrupted Father D&aacute;maso, &ldquo;but I
scorn architects and the simpletons who make use of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the
alcalde, as Ibarra was silent, &ldquo;when certain buildings are in
question, like a school, for example, an expert is
needed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;An expert!&rdquo; cried the
father, with sarcasm. &ldquo;One needs be more stupid than the Indians,
who build their own houses, not to know how to raise four walls and put
a roof on them. Nothing else is needed for a school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one looked at Ibarra, but, though he grew a little pale, he
pursued his conversation with Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But does your reverence
consider&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; continued the
Franciscan, again cutting off the alcalde. &ldquo;See how one of our
lay brothers, the most stupid one we have, built a hospital. He paid
the workmen eight cuartos a day, and got them from other pueblos, too.
Not much like these young feather-brains who ruin workmen, paying them
three or four r&eacute;ales!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Does your reverence say he paid
but eight cuartos? Impossible!&rdquo; said the alcalde, hoping to
change the course of the conversation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or, and so should
those do who pride themselves upon being good Spaniards. Since the
opening of the Suez Canal, corruption has reached even here! When the
Cape had to be doubled, not so many ruined men came here, and fewer
went abroad to ruin themselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But Father
D&aacute;maso&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know the Indian; as soon as he
has learned anything, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3432" href=
"#xd21e3432" name="xd21e3432">140</a>]</span>he takes a title. All
these beardless youths who go to Europe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, your reverence,
listen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the alcalde, alarmed by the harshness
of these words.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Finish as they merit,&rdquo;
continued the priest. &ldquo;The hand of God is in it; he is blind who
does not see that. Already even the fathers of these reptiles receive
their chastisement; they die in prison! Ah&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. Ibarra, livid, had been watching him. At these
words he rose, gave one bound, and struck out with his strong hand. The
monk, stunned by the blow, fell backward.</p>
<p>Surprised and terrified, not one of the spectators moved.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let no one come near!&rdquo; said
the young man in a terrible voice, drawing his slender blade, and
holding the neck of the priest with his foot. &ldquo;Let no one come,
unless he wishes to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was beside himself, his whole body trembled, his threatening
eyes were big with rage. Father D&aacute;maso, regaining his senses,
made an effort to rise, but Cris&oacute;stomo, grasping his neck, shook
him till he had brought him to his knees.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or de Ibarra!
Se&ntilde;or de Ibarra!&rdquo; stammered one and another. But nobody,
not even the alf&eacute;rez, risked a movement. They saw the knife
glitter; they calculated Cris&oacute;stomo&rsquo;s strength, unleashed
by anger; they were paralyzed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;All you here, you have said
nothing. Now it rests with me. I avoided him; God brings him to me. Let
God judge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra breathed with effort, but his arm of iron kept harsh hold of
the Franciscan, who struggled in vain to free himself.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My heart beats true, my hand is
firm&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And he looked about him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3455" href="#xd21e3455" name=
"xd21e3455">141</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I ask you first, is there among
you any one who has not loved his father, who has not loved his
father&rsquo;s memory; any one born in shame and abasement? See, hear
this silence! Priest of a God of peace, thy mouth full of sanctity and
religion, thy heart of corruption! Thou canst not know what it is to be
a father; thou shouldst have thought of thy own! See, in all this crowd
that you scorn there is not one like you! You are judged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests, believing he was going to strike, made their first
movement.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do not come near us!&rdquo; he
cried again in the same threatening voice. &ldquo;What? You fear I
shall stain my hand in impure blood? Did I not tell you that my heart
beats true? Away from us, and listen, priests, believing yourselves
different from other men, giving yourselves other rights! My father was
an honorable man. Ask the country which venerates his memory. My father
was a good citizen, who <span class="corr" id="xd21e3463" title=
"Source: sacrified">sacrificed</span> himself for me and for his
country&rsquo;s good. His house was open, his table set for the
stranger or the exile who should turn to him! He was a Christian;
always doing good, never pressing the weak, nor forcing tears from the
wretched. As to this man, he opened his door to him, made him sit down
at his table, and called him friend. And how did the man respond? He
falsely accused him; he pursued him; he armed ignorance against him!
Confiding in the sanctity of his office, he outraged his tomb,
dishonored his memory; his hate troubled even the rest of the dead. And
not yet satisfied, he now pursues the son. I fled from him, avoided his
presence. You heard him this morning profane the chair, point me out to
the people&rsquo;s fanaticism; but I said nothing. Now, he comes here
to seek a quarrel; I suffer in silence, until he again insults a memory
sacred to all sons.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You who are here, priests,
magistrates, have you seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3468"
href="#xd21e3468" name="xd21e3468">142</a>]</span>your old father give
himself for you, part from you for your good, die of grief in a prison,
looking for your embrace, looking for consolation from any one who
would bring it, sick, alone; while you in a foreign land? Then have you
heard his name dishonored, found his tomb empty when you went there to
pray? No? You are silent; then you condemn him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his arm. But a girl, rapid as light, threw herself between
him and the priest, and with her fragile hands held the avenging arm.
It was Maria Clara. Ibarra looked at her with eyes like a
madman&rsquo;s. Then, little by little, his tense fingers relaxed; he
let fall the knife, and, covering his face with his hands, he fled.

<h2 class="main">Opinions.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The noise of the affair spread rapidly. At first no
one believed it, but when there was no longer room for doubt, each made
his comments, according to the degree of his moral elevation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso is
dead,&rdquo; said some. &ldquo;When he was carried away, his face was
congested with blood, and he no longer breathed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May he rest in peace, but he has
only paid his debt!&rdquo; said a young stranger.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;One of us students who came from
Manila for the f&ecirc;te left the church when the sermon in Tagalo
began, saying it was Greek to him. Father D&aacute;maso sent for him
afterward, and they came to blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are we returning to the times of
Nero?&rdquo; asked another student.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You mistake,&rdquo; replied the
first. &ldquo;Nero was an artist, and Father D&aacute;maso is a jolly
poor preacher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men of more years talked otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To say which was wrong and which
right is not easy,&rdquo; said the gobernadorcillo, &ldquo;and yet, if
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra had been more moderate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You probably mean, if Father
D&aacute;maso had shown half the moderation of Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra,&rdquo; interrupted Don Filipo. &ldquo;The pity is that the
r&ocirc;les were interchanged: the youth <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3499" href="#xd21e3499" name="xd21e3499">144</a>]</span>conducted
himself like an old man, and the old man like a youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you say nobody but the
daughter of Captain Tiago came between them? Not a monk, nor the
alcalde?&rdquo; asked Captain Martin. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to
be in the young man&rsquo;s shoes. None of those who were afraid of him
will ever forgive him. Hah, that&rsquo;s the worst of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; demanded
Captain Basilio, with interest.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Don Filipo,
exchanging glances with Captain Basilio, &ldquo;that the pueblo
isn&rsquo;t going to desert him. His friends at
least&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo;
interrupted the gobernadorcillo, &ldquo;what can we do? What can the
pueblo? Whatever happens, the monks are always in the
right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They are always in the right,
because we always say they&rsquo;re in the right. Let us say we are in
the right for once, and then we shall have something to talk
about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gobernadorcillo shook his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, the young blood!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to know what country you live in; you
don&rsquo;t know your compatriots. The monks are rich; they are united;
we are poor and divided. Try to defend him and you will see how you are
left to compromise yourself alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Don Filipo
bitterly, &ldquo;and it will be so as long as fear and prudence are
supposed to be synonymous. Each thinks of himself, nobody of any one
else; that is why we are weak!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Very well! Think of others and see
how soon the others will let you hang!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of
it!&rdquo; cried the exasperated lieutenant. &ldquo;I shall give my
resignation to the alcalde to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women had still other thoughts.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; said one of them.
&ldquo;Young people are always <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3526"
href="#xd21e3526" name="xd21e3526">145</a>]</span>the same. If his good
mother were living, what would she say? When I think that my son, who
is a young hothead, too, might have done the same
thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not with you,&rdquo;
said another woman. &ldquo;I should have nothing against my two sons if
they did as Don Cris&oacute;stomo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you saying, Capitana
Maria?&rdquo; cried the first woman, clasping her hands.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor stupid,&rdquo;
said a third, the Capitana Tinay, &ldquo;but I know what I&rsquo;m
going to do. I&rsquo;m going to tell my son not to study any more. They
say men of learning all die on the gallows. Holy Mary, and my son wants
to go to Europe!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I were rich as you, my children
should travel,&rdquo; said the Capitana Maria. &ldquo;Our sons ought to
aspire to be more than their fathers. I have not long to live, and we
shall meet again in the other world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your ideas, Capitana Maria, are
little Christian,&rdquo; said Sister Rufa severely. &ldquo;Make
yourself a sister of the Sacred Rosary, or of St. Francis.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sister Rufa, when I&rsquo;m a
worthy sister of men, I will think about being a sister of the
saints,&rdquo; said the capitana, smiling.</p>
<p>Under the booth where the children had their feast the father of the
one who was to be a doctor was talking.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What troubles me most,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;is that the school will not be finished; my son will not be
a doctor, but a carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who said there wouldn&rsquo;t be a
school?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I say so. The White Fathers have
called Don Cris&oacute;stomo plibastiero. There won&rsquo;t be any
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peasants questioned each other&rsquo;s faces. The word was new
to them.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And is that a bad name?&rdquo; one
at last ventured to ask. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3553" href=
"#xd21e3553" name="xd21e3553">146</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst one Christian
can give another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Worse than tarantado and
saragate?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t, it
wouldn&rsquo;t amount to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come now. It can&rsquo;t be worse
than indio, as the alf&eacute;rez says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whose son was to be a carter looked gloomy. The other shook his
head and reflected.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then is it as bad as betalapora,
that the old woman of the alf&eacute;rez says?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You remember the word
<i>ispichoso</i> (suspect), which had only to be said of a man to have
the guards lead him off to prison? Well, plibastiero is worse yet; if
any one calls you plibastiero, you can confess and pay your debts, for
there&rsquo;s nothing else left to do but get yourself hanged.
That&rsquo;s what the telegrapher and the sub-director say, and you
know whether the telegrapher and the sub-director ought to know: one
talks with iron wires, and the other knows Spanish, and handles nothing
but the pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last hope fled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3573" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The home of Captain Tiago was naturally not less
disturbed than the minds of the crowd. Maria Clara refused to be
comforted by her aunt and her foster-sister. Her father had forbidden
her to speak to Cris&oacute;stomo until the ban of excommunication
should be raised.</p>
<p>In the midst of his preparations for receiving the governor-general
Captain Tiago was summoned to the convent.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, my child,&rdquo;
said Aunt Isabel, as she polished the mirrors with a chamois skin,
&ldquo;the ban will be raised. They will write to the holy father. We
will make a big offering. Father D&aacute;maso only fainted; he
isn&rsquo;t dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; whispered
Andeng; &ldquo;I will arrange to meet Cris&oacute;stomo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last Captain Tiago came back. They scanned his face for answers
to many questions; but the face of Captain Tiago spoke discouragement.
The poor man passed his hand across his brow and seemed unable to frame
a word.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, Santiago?&rdquo; demanded
the anxious aunt.</p>
<p>He wiped away a tear and replied by a sigh.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speak, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!
What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What I all the time feared,&rdquo;
he said at last, conquering his tears. &ldquo;Everything is lost!
Father D&aacute;maso orders me to break the promise of marriage. They
all say the same thing, even Father Sibyla. I must shut the doors of my
house to him, and&mdash;I owe him more than fifty thousand pesos! I
told the fathers so, but they wouldn&rsquo;t take it into account.
&lsquo;Which would you rather lose,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;fifty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3597" href="#xd21e3597" name=
"xd21e3597">148</a>]</span>thousand pesos or your soul?&rsquo; Ah, St.
Anthony, if I had known, if I had known!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara was sobbing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, my child,&rdquo;
he said, turning to her; &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t like your mother; she
never cried. Father D&aacute;maso told me that a young friend of his is
coming from Spain; he intends him for your
fianc&eacute;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara stopped her ears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, Santiago, are you mad?&rdquo;
cried Aunt Isabel. &ldquo;Speak to her of another fianc&eacute; now? Do
you think your daughter changes them as she does her gloves?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have thought about it, Isabel;
but what would you have me do? They threaten me, too, with
excommunication.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you do nothing but distress
your daughter! Aren&rsquo;t you the friend of the archbishop? Why
don&rsquo;t you write to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The archbishop is a monk, too. He
will do only what the monks say. But don&rsquo;t cry, Maria; the
governor-general is coming. He will want to see you, and your eyes will
be red. Alas, I thought I was going to have such a good afternoon!
Without this misfortune I should be the happiest of men, with everybody
envying me! Be calm, my child, I am more unhappy than you, and I
don&rsquo;t cry. You may find a better fianc&eacute;; but as for me, I
lose fifty thousand pesos! Ah, Virgin of Antipolo, if only I have luck
tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salvos, the sound of wheels and of horses galloping, the band
playing the Royal March, announced the arrival of His Excellency the
governor-general of the Philippine Islands. Maria Clara ran to hide in
her chamber. Poor girl! Her heart was at the mercy of rude hands that
had no sense of its delicate fibres.</p>
<p>While the house was filling with people, while heavy footsteps,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3618" href="#xd21e3618" name=
"xd21e3618">149</a>]</span>words of command, and the hurling of sabres
and spurs resounded all about, the poor child, heart-broken, was
half-lying, half-kneeling before that picture of the Virgin where
Delaroche represents her in a grievous solitude, as though he had
surprised her returning from the sepulchre of her son. Maria Clara did
not think of the grief of this mother; she thought only of her own. Her
head bent on her breast, her hands pressed against the floor, she
seemed a lily broken by the storm. A future for years caressed in
dreams, illusions born in childhood, fostered in youth, grown a part of
her being, they thought to shatter all these with a word, to drive it
all out of her mind and heart. A devout Catholic, a loving daughter,
the excommunication terrified her. Not so much her father&rsquo;s
commands as her desire for his peace of mind demanded from her the
sacrifice of her love. And in this moment she felt for the first time
the full strength of her affection for Cris&oacute;stomo. The peaceful
river glides over its sandy bed under the nodding flowers along its
banks; the wind scarcely ridges its current; it seems to sleep; but
farther down the banks close in, rough rocks choke the channel, a heap
of knotty trunks forms a dyke; then the river roars, revolts, its
waters whirl, and shake their plumes of spray, and, raging, beat the
rocks and rush on madly. So this tranquil love was now transformed and
the tempests were let loose.</p>
<p>She would have prayed; but who can pray without hope? &ldquo;O
God!&rdquo; her heart complained. &ldquo;Why refuse a man the love of
others? Thou givest him the sunshine and the air; thou dost not hide
from him the sight of heaven. Why take away that love without which he
cannot live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor child, who had never known a mother of her own, had brought
her grief to that pure heart which knew only filial and maternal love,
to that divine image of womanhood of whose tenderness we dream, whom we
call Mary. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3624" href="#xd21e3624"
name="xd21e3624">150</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother, mother!&rdquo; she
sobbed.</p>
<p>Aunt Isabel came to find her; her friends were there, and the
governor-general had asked for her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dear aunt, tell them I am
ill!&rdquo; she begged in terror. &ldquo;They will want me to play and
sing!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your father has promised. Would
you make your father break his word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara rose, looked at her aunt, threw out her beautiful arms
with a sob, then stood still till she was outwardly calm, and went to
obey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3636" href="#xd21e3636" name=

<h2 class="main">His Excellency.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I want to talk with that
young man,&rdquo; said the general to one of his aids; &ldquo;he rouses
all my interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He has been sent for, my general;
but there is here another young man of Manila who insists upon seeing
you. We told him you have not the time; that you did not come to give
audiences. He replied that Your Excellency has always the time to do
justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general, perplexed, turned to the alcalde.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I am not mistaken,&rdquo; said
the alcalde, with an inclination of the head, &ldquo;it is a student
who this morning had trouble with Father D&aacute;maso about the
sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Another still? Has this monk
started out to put the province to revolt, or does he think he commands
here? Admit the young man!&rdquo; And the governor got up and walked
nervously back and forth.</p>
<p>In the ante-chamber some Spanish officers and all the functionaries
of the pueblo were talking in groups. All the monks, too, except Father
D&aacute;maso, had come to pay their respects to the governor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;His Excellency begs your
reverences to attend a moment,&rdquo; said the aide-de-camp.
&ldquo;Enter, young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Manilian who confounded the Tagalo with the Greek entered,
trembling.</p>
<p>Every one was greatly astonished. His Excellency must be much
annoyed to make the monks wait this way. Said Brother Sibyla:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3660" href="#xd21e3660" name=
"xd21e3660">152</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have nothing to say to him, and
I&rsquo;m wasting my time here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I also,&rdquo; said an Augustin.
&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Would it not be better to find out
what he thinks?&rdquo; asked Brother Salvi. &ldquo;We should avoid a
scandal, and we could remind him&mdash;of his
duty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your reverences may enter,&rdquo;
said the aid, conducting back the young man, who came out radiant.</p>
<p>The fathers went in and saluted the governor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who among your reverences is the
Brother D&aacute;maso?&rdquo; demanded His Excellency at once, without
asking them to be seated or inquiring for their health, and without any
of those complimentary phrases which form the repertory of
dignitaries.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, Father D&aacute;maso
is not with us,&rdquo; replied Father Sibyla, in a tone almost as
dry.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency&rsquo;s servant is
ill,&rdquo; added the humble Brother Salvi. &ldquo;We come, after
saluting Your Excellency and inquiring for his health, to speak in the
name of Your Excellency&rsquo;s respectful servant, who has had the
misfortune&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted the
captain-general, with a nervous smile, while he twirled a chair on one
leg. &ldquo;If all the servants of my Excellency were like the Father
D&aacute;maso, I should prefer to serve my Excellency
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their reverences did not seem to know what to reply.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your reverences sit
down?&rdquo; added the governor in more conventional tone.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago, in evening dress and walking on tiptoe, came in,
leading by the hand Maria Clara, hesitating, timid. Overcoming her
agitation, she made her salute, at once ceremonial and graceful.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This sig&ntilde;orita is your
daughter!&rdquo; exclaimed the surprised governor. &ldquo;Happy the
fathers whose daughters are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3689"
href="#xd21e3689" name="xd21e3689">153</a>]</span>like you,
sig&ntilde;orita. They have told me about you, and I wish to thank you
in the name of His Majesty the King, who loves the peace and
tranquillity of his subjects, and in my own name, in that of a father
who has daughters. If there is anything you would wish,
sig&ntilde;orita&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; protested
Maria, trembling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Se&ntilde;or Don Juan
Cris&oacute;stomo Ibarra awaits Your Excellency&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo;
announced the ringing voice of the aide-de-camp.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Permit me, sig&ntilde;orita, to
see you again before I leave the pueblo. I have yet things to say to
you. Se&ntilde;or acalde, Your Highness will accompany me on the walk I
wish to take after the private conference I shall have with the
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; said
Father Salvi humbly, &ldquo;will permit us to inform him that the
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra is excommunicated&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general broke in.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;in being troubled about nothing but the state of Father
D&aacute;maso. I sincerely desire his complete recovery, for, at his
age, a voyage to Spain in search of health would be somewhat
disagreeable. But all depends upon him. Meanwhile, God preserve the
health of your reverences!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All retired.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In his own case also everything
depends upon him,&rdquo; murmured Brother Salvi as he went out.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall see who makes the
earliest voyage to Spain!&rdquo; added another Franciscan.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall go immediately,&rdquo;
said Father Sibyla, in vexation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We, too,&rdquo; grumbled the
Augustins.</p>
<p>Both parties bore it ill that for the fault of a Franciscan His
Excellency should have received them so coldly. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3716" href="#xd21e3716" name=

<p>In the ante-chamber they encountered Ibarra, who a few hours before
had been their host. There was no exchange of greetings, but there were
eloquent looks. The alcalde, on the contrary, gave Ibarra his hand. On
the threshold Cris&oacute;stomo met Maria coming out. Looks spoke
again, but very differently this time.</p>
<p>Though this encounter with the monks had seemed to him of bad
augury, Ibarra presented himself in the utmost calm. He bowed
profoundly. The captain-general came forward.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It gives me the greatest
satisfaction, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, to take you by the hand. I hope for
your entire confidence.&rdquo; And he examined the young man with
evident satisfaction.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, so much
kindness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your surprise shows that you did
not expect a friendly reception; that was to doubt my
fairness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A friendly reception,
se&ntilde;or, for an insignificant subject of His Majesty, like myself,
is not fairness, but favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the
general, sitting down and motioning Cris&oacute;stomo to a seat.
&ldquo;Let us have a moment of open hearts. I am much gratified by what
you are doing, and have proposed you to the Government of His Majesty
for a decoration in recompense for your project of the school. Had you
invited me, I should have found it a pleasure to be here for the
ceremony. Perhaps I should have been able to save you an annoyance. But
as to what happened between you and Father D&aacute;maso, have neither
fear nor regrets. Not a hair of your head shall be harmed so long as I
govern the islands; and in regard to the excommunication, I will talk
with the archbishop. We must conform ourselves to our circumstances. We
cannot laugh at it here, as we might in Europe. But be more prudent in
the future. You have weighted yourself with the religious orders, who,
from their office and their wealth, must be respected. I protect
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3731" href="#xd21e3731" name=
"xd21e3731">155</a>]</span>you, because I like a good son. By heaven, I
don&rsquo;t know what I should have done in your place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, quickly changing the subject, he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They tell me you have just
returned from Europe. You were in Madrid?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or, several
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How happens it that you return
without bringing me a letter of recommendation?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied
Ibarra, bowing, &ldquo;because, having heard there of the character of
Your Excellency, I thought a letter of recommendation would not only be
unnecessary, but might even offend you; the Filipinos are all
recommended to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile curled the lips of the old soldier, who replied slowly, as
though meditating and weighing his words:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I cannot help being flattered that
you think so. And yet, young man, you should know what a weight rests
on our shoulders. Here we old soldiers have to be all&mdash;king,
ministers of state, of war, of justice, of everything; and yet, in
every event, we have to consult the far-off mother country, which often
must approve or reject our propositions with blind justice. If in Spain
itself, with the advantage of everything near and familiar, all is
imperfect and defective, the wonder is that all here is not revolution.
It is not lack of good will in the governors, but we must use the eyes
and arms of strangers, of whom, for the most part, we can know nothing,
and who, instead of serving their country, may be serving only their
own interests. The monks are a powerful aid, but they are not
sufficient. You inspire great interest in me, and I would not have the
imperfection of our governmental system tell in anyway against you. I
cannot watch over any one; every one cannot come to me. Tell me, can I
be useful to you in any way? Have you any request to make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra reflected. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3750" href=
"#xd21e3750" name="xd21e3750">156</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;my great desire is for the happiness of my country, and I would
that happiness might be due to the efforts of our mother country and of
my fellow-citizens united to her and united among themselves by the
eternal bonds of common views and interests. What I would ask, the
Government alone can give, and that after many continuous years of
labor and of well-conceived reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general gave him a long look, which Ibarra bore naturally,
without timidity, without boldness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are the first man with whom
I&rsquo;ve spoken in this country,&rdquo; cried His Excellency,
stretching out his hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your Excellency has seen only
those who while away their lives in cities; he has not visited the
falsely maligned cabins of our villages. There Your Excellency would be
able to see veritable men, if to be a man a noble heart and simple
manners are enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain-general rose and walked up and down the room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo; he
said, stopping before Cris&oacute;stomo, &ldquo;your education and
manner of thinking are not for this country. Sell what you own and come
with me when I go back to Europe; the climate will be better for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall remember all my life this
kindness of Your Excellency,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, moved; &ldquo;but I
must live in the country where my parents
lived&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where they died, you would say
more justly. Believe me, I, perhaps, know your country better than you
do yourself. Ah, but I forget! You are to marry an adorable girl, and
I&rsquo;m keeping you from her all this time! Go&mdash;go to her! And
that you may have more freedom, send the father to me,&rdquo; he added,
smiling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, though, that I want your company
for the promenade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra saluted, and went out. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3770" href="#xd21e3770" name="xd21e3770">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>The general called his aide-de-camp.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am pleased,&rdquo; said he,
giving him a light tap on the shoulder; &ldquo;I have seen to-day for
the first time how one may be a good Spaniard without ceasing to be a
good Filipino. What a pity that this Ibarra some day or
other&mdash;&mdash;but call the alcalde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge at once presented himself.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or alcalde,&rdquo; said
the general, &ldquo;to avoid a repetition of scenes like those of which
you were a spectator to-day&mdash;scenes, I deplore, because they
reflect upon the Government and upon all Spaniards&mdash;I recommend
the Se&ntilde;or Ibarra to your utmost care and
consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alcalde perceived the reprimand and lowered his eyes.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago presented himself, stiff and unnatural.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Santiago,&rdquo; the general
said affectionately, &ldquo;a moment ago I congratulated you upon
having a daughter like the Se&ntilde;orita de los Santos. Now I make
you my compliments upon your future son-in-law. The most virtuous of
daughters is worthy of the first citizen of the Philippines. May I know
the day of the wedding?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
stammered Captain Tiago, wiping drops of sweat from his brow.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then nothing is settled, I see. If
witnesses are lacking, it will give me the greatest pleasure to be one
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said
Captain Tiago, with a smile to stir compassion.</p>
<p>Ibarra had gone off almost running to find Maria Clara. He had so
much to talk over with her. Through a door he heard the murmur of
girls&rsquo; voices. He knocked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; asked
Maria.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices were hushed, but the door did not open. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3800" href="#xd21e3800" name=
"xd21e3800">158</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I. May I come
in?&rdquo; demanded Cris&oacute;stomo, his heart beginning to beat
violently.</p>
<p>The silence continued. After some moments, light foot-steps
approached the door, and the voice of Sinang said through the
keyhole:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cris&oacute;stomo, we&rsquo;re
going to the theatre to-night. Write what you have to say to Maria
Clara.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; said
Ibarra to himself as he slowly left the door. <span class=

<h2 class="label">XXXII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Procession.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That evening, in the light of countless lanterns, to
the sound of bells and of continuous detonations, the procession
started for the fourth time.</p>
<p>The captain-general, who had set out on foot, accompanied by his two
aides-de-camp, Captain Tiago, the alcalde, the alf&eacute;rez, and
Ibarra, and preceded by the guards, to open a passage, was to view the
procession from the house of the gobernadorcillo. This functionary had
built a platform for the recitation of a loa, a religious poem in honor
of the patron saint.</p>
<p>Ibarra would gladly have renounced the hearing of this composition,
but His Excellency had ordered his attendance, and Cris&oacute;stomo
must console himself with the thought of seeing his fianc&eacute;e at
the theatre.</p>
<p>The procession began by the march of the silver candelabra, borne by
three sacristans. Then came the school children and their master, then
other children, all with paper lanterns, shaped and ornamented
according to the taste of each child&mdash;for each was his own
lantern-maker&mdash;hoisted on bamboo poles of various lengths and
lighted by bits of candles. An effigy of St. John the Baptist followed,
borne on a litter, and then came St. Francis, surrounded by crystal
lamps. A band followed, and then the standard of the saint, borne by
the brothers of the Third Order, praying aloud in a sort of
lamentation. San Diego came next, his car drawn by six brothers of the
Third Order, probably fulfilling <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e3824" href="#xd21e3824" name="xd21e3824">160</a>]</span>some vow.
St. Mary Magdalen followed him, a beautiful image with splendid hair,
wearing a costume of silk spangled with gold, and holding a
handkerchief of embroidered pi&ntilde;a in her jewelled hands. Lights
and incense surrounded her, and her glass tears reflected the varied
colors of Bengal lights. St. John the Baptist moved far ahead, as if
ashamed of his camel&rsquo;s hair beside all this gold and glitter.</p>
<p>After the Magdalen came the women of the order, the elder first, so
that the young girls should surround the car of the Virgin; behind them
was the curate under his dais. The car of the Virgin was preceded by
men dressed as phantoms, to the great terror of the children; the women
wore habits like those of religious orders. In the midst of this
obscure mass of robes and cowls and cordons one saw, like dainty
jasmines, like fresh sampages amid old rags, twelve little girls in
white, their hair free. Their eyes shone like their necklaces. One
might have thought them little genii of the light taken prisoner by
spectres. By two wide blue ribbons they were attached to the car of the
Virgin, like the doves which draw the car of Spring.</p>
<p>At the gobernadorcillo&rsquo;s the procession stopped, all the
images and their attendants were drawn up around the platform, and all
eyes were fixed on the half-open curtain. At length it parted, and a
young man appeared, winged, booted like a cavalier, with sash and belt
and plumed hat, and in Latin, Castilian, and Tagal recited a poem as
extraordinary as his attire. The verses ended, St. John pursued his
bitter way.</p>
<p>At the moment when the figure of the Virgin passed the house of
Captain Tiago, a celestial song greeted it. It was a voice, sweet and
tender, almost weeping out the Gounod &ldquo;Ave Maria.&rdquo; The
music of the procession died away, the prayers ceased. Father Salvi
himself stood still. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3832" href=
"#xd21e3832" name="xd21e3832">161</a>]</span>voice trembled; it drew
tears; it was more than a salutation: it was a supplication and a
complaint.</p>
<p>Ibarra heard, and fear and darkness entered his heart. He felt the
suffering in the voice and dared not ask himself whence it came.</p>
<p>The captain-general was speaking to him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I should like your company at
table. We will talk to those children who have disappeared,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Cris&oacute;stomo, looking at the general without seeing him, asked
himself under his breath: &ldquo;Can I be the cause?&rdquo; And he
followed the governor mechanically. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="label">XXXIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Do&ntilde;a Consolacion.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Why were the windows of the house of the
alf&eacute;rez not only without lanterns, but shuttered? Where, when
the procession passed, were the masculine head with its great veins and
purple lips, the flannel shirt, and the big cigar of the &ldquo;Muse of
the Municipal Guard&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The house was sad, as Sinang said, because the people were gay. Had
not a sentinel paced as usual before the door one might have thought
the place uninhabited.</p>
<p>A feeble light showed the disorder of the room, where the
alf&eacute;reza was sitting, and pierced the dusty and spider-webbed
conches of the windows. The dame, according to her idle custom, was
dozing in a fauteuil. To deaden the sound of the bombs, she had coifed
her head in a handkerchief, from which escaped her tangled hair, short
and thin. This morning she had not been to mass, not because she did
not wish it, but because her husband had not permitted it, accompanying
his prohibition with oaths and threats of blows. Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion was now dreaming of revenge. She bestirred herself at last
and ran over the house from one end to the other, her dark face
disquieting to look at. A spark flashed from her eyes like that from
the pupil of a serpent trapped and about to be crushed. It was cold,
luminous, penetrating; it was viscous, cruel, repulsive. The smallest
error on the part of a servant, the least noise, drew forth words
injurious enough to smirch the soul; but nobody replied; to offer
excuse would have been to commit another crime. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3855" href="#xd21e3855" name=
"xd21e3855">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this way the day passed. Meeting no opposition&mdash;her husband
had been invited to the gobernadorcillo&rsquo;s&mdash;she stored up
spleen; the cells of her organism seemed slowly charging with electric
force, which burst out, later on, in a tempest.</p>
<p>Sisa had been in the barracks since her arrest the day before. The
alf&eacute;rez, fearing she might become the sport of the crowd, had
ordered her to be kept until the f&ecirc;te was over.</p>
<p>This evening, whether she had heard the song of Maria Clara, whether
the bands had recalled airs that she knew, for some reason she began to
chant, in her sympathetic voice, the songs of her youth. The soldiers
heard and became still; they knew these airs, had sung them themselves
when they were young and free and innocent. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion
heard, too, and inquired for the singer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have her come up at once,&rdquo;
she said, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, something like a smile
flickering on her dry lips.</p>
<p>The soldiers brought Sisa, who came without fear or question. When
she entered she seemed to see no one, which wounded the vanity of the
dreadful muse. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion coughed, motioned the soldiers
to withdraw, and, taking down her husband&rsquo;s riding whip, said in
a sinister voice:</p>
<p lang="tl" class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Vamos, magcanter
icau!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an order to sing, in a mixture of Castilian and Tagalo.
Do&ntilde;a Consolacion affected ignorance of her native tongue,
thinking thus to give herself the air of a veritable <i>Orofea</i>, as
she said in her attempt at Europea. For if she martyred the Tagalo, she
treated Castilian worse, though her husband, and chairs and shoes, had
contributed to giving her lessons.</p>
<p>Sisa had been happy enough not to understand. The forehead of the
shrew unknotted a bit, and a look of satisfaction animated her face.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3876" href="#xd21e3876" name=
"xd21e3876">164</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell this woman to sing!&rdquo;
she said to the orderly. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t understand; she
doesn&rsquo;t know Spanish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orderly spoke to Sisa, and she began at once the &ldquo;Night
Song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Do&ntilde;a Consolacion listened with a mocking smile, but
little by little it left her lips. She became attentive, then serious.
Her dry and withered heart received the rain. &ldquo;The sadness, the
cold, the dew come down from the sky in the mantle of the night,&rdquo;
seemed to fall upon her heart; she understood &ldquo;the flower, full
of vanity, and prodigal with its splendors in the sun, now, at the fall
of day, withered and stained, repentant and disillusioned, trying to
raise its poor petals toward heaven, begging a shade to hide it from
the mockery of the sun, who had seen it in its pomp, and was laughing
at the impotence of its pride; begging also a drop of dew to be let
fall upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No! Stop singing!&rdquo; she cried
in perfect Tagal. &ldquo;Stop! These verses bore me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa stopped. The orderly thought: &ldquo;Ah, she knows the
Tagal!&rdquo; And he regarded his mistress with admiration.</p>
<p>She saw she had betrayed herself, became ashamed, and shame in her
unfeminine nature meant rage. She showed the door to the imprudent
orderly, and shut it behind him with a blow. Then she took several
turns around the room, wringing the whip in her nervous hands. At last,
planting herself before Sisa, she said to her in Spanish:
&ldquo;Dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisa did not move.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dance! Dance!&rdquo; she repeated
in a threatening voice. The poor thing looked at her with vacant eyes.
The vixen took hold of one of her arms and then the other, raising them
and swaying them about. It was of no use. Sisa did not understand.</p>
<p>In vain Do&ntilde;a Consolacion began to leap about, making signs
for Sisa to imitate her. In the distance a band was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3895" href="#xd21e3895" name=
"xd21e3895">165</a>]</span>playing a slow and majestic march; but the
creature leaped furiously to another measure, beating within herself.
Sisa looked on, motionless. A faint curiosity rose in her eyes, a
feeble smile moved her pale lips; the alf&eacute;reza&rsquo;s dance
pleased her.</p>
<p>The dancer stopped, as if ashamed, and raised the terrible whip,
well known to thieves and soldiers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s your turn! Dance!&rdquo; And she began to give light
taps to the bare feet of bewildered Sisa, whose face contracted with
pain; the poor thing tried to ward off the blows with her hands.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! You&rsquo;re beginning, are
you?&rdquo; cried Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, with savage joy, and from
lento, she passed to allegro vivace.</p>
<p>Sisa cried out and drew up first one foot and then the other.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Will you dance, accursed
Indian!&rdquo; and the whip whistled.</p>
<p>Sisa let herself fall to the floor, trying to cover her feet, and
looking at her tormenter with haggard eyes. Two lashes on the shoulders
forced her to rise with screams.</p>
<p>Her thin chemise was torn, the skin broken and the blood
flowing.</p>
<p>This excited Do&ntilde;a Consolacion still more.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Dance! Dance!&rdquo; she howled,
and seizing Sisa with one hand, while she beat her with the other, she
commenced to leap about again.</p>
<p>At length Sisa understood, and followed, moving her arms without
rhythm or measure. A smile of satisfaction came to the lips of the
horrible woman&mdash;the smile of a female Mephistopheles who has found
an apt pupil: hate, scorn, mockery, and cruelty were in it; a burst of
demoniacal laughter could not have said more.</p>
<p>Absorbed by her delight in this spectacle, the alf&eacute;reza did
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3920" href="#xd21e3920" name=
"xd21e3920">166</a>]</span>not know that her husband had arrived until
the door was violently thrown open with a kick.</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez was pale and morose. When he saw what was going
on, he darted a terrible glance at his wife, then quietly put his hand
on the shoulder of the strange dancer, and stopped her motion. Sisa,
breathing hard, sat down on the floor. He called the orderly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take this woman away,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;see that she is properly cared for, and has a good dinner
and a good bed. To-morrow she is to be taken to Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he carefully closed the door after them, pushed the bolt, and
approached his wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3929" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The first
rockets were slowly going up in the dark sky, where bright-colored
balloons shone like new stars. On the ridge-poles of the houses men
were seen armed with bamboo poles, with pails of water at hand. Their
dark silhouettes against the clear gray of the night seemed phantoms
come to share in the gayety of men. They were there to look out for
balloons that might fall burning.</p>
<p>Crowds of people were going toward the plaza to see the last play at
the theatre. Bengal fires burned here and there, grouping the
merry-makers fantastically.</p>
<p>The grand estrade was magnificently illuminated. Thousands of lights
were fixed round the pillars, hung from the roof and clustered near the
ground.</p>
<p>In front of the stage the orchestra was tuning its instruments. The
dignitaries of the pueblo, the Spaniards, and wealthy strangers
occupied seats in rows. The people filled the rest of the place; some
had brought benches, rather to mount them than to sit on them, and
others noisily protested against this.</p>
<p>Comings and goings, cries, exclamations, bursts of laughter, jokes,
a whistle, swelled the tumult. Here the leg of a bench gave way and
precipitated those on it, to the delight of the spectators; there was a
dispute for place; and a little beyond a fracas of glasses and bottles.
It was Andeng, carrying a great tray of drinks, and unfortunately she
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3946" href="#xd21e3946" name=
"xd21e3946">168</a>]</span>encountered her fianc&eacute;, who was
disposed to profit by the occasion.</p>
<p>The lieutenant, Don Filipo, was in charge of the spectacle, for the
gobernadorcillo was playing monte, of which he was a passionate
devotee. Don Filipo was talking with old Tasio, who was on the point of
leaving.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to see the
play?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, thank you! My own mind
suffices for rambling and dreaming,&rdquo; replied the philosopher,
laughing. &ldquo;But I have a question to propose. Have you ever
observed the strange nature of our people? Pacific, they love warlike
spectacles; democratic, they adore emperors, kings, and princes;
irreligious, they ruin themselves in the pomps of the ritual; the
nature of our women is gentle, but they have deliriums of delight when
a princess brandishes a lance. Do you know the cause of all this?
Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrival of Maria Clara and her friends cut short the
conversation. Don Filipo accompanied them to their places. Then came
the curate, with his usual retinue.</p>
<p>The evening began with Chananay and Marianito in &ldquo;Crispino and
the Gossip.&rdquo; The scene fixed the attention of every one. The act
was ending when Ibarra entered. His coming excited a murmur, and eyes
turned from him to the curate. But Cris&oacute;stomo observed nothing.
He gracefully saluted Maria and her friends and sat down. The only one
who spoke to him was Sinang.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have you been watching the
fireworks?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, little friend, I had to
accompany the governor-general.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That was too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Salvi had risen, gone to Don Filipo, and appeared to be
having with him a serious discussion. He spoke with heat, the
lieutenant calmly and quietly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am sorry not to be able to
satisfy your reverence, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e3969"
href="#xd21e3969" name="xd21e3969">169</a>]</span>Se&ntilde;or Ibarra
is one of the chief contributors to the f&ecirc;te, and has a perfect
right to be here so long as he creates no disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But is it not creating a
disturbance to scandalize all good Christians?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; replied Don Filipo,
&ldquo;my slight authority does not permit me to interfere in religious
matters. Let those who fear Se&ntilde;or Ibarra&rsquo;s contact avoid
him: he forces himself upon no one; the se&ntilde;or alcalde and the
captain-general have been in his company all the afternoon; it hardly
becomes me to give them a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you do not put him out of the
place, we shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I should be very sorry, but I have
no authority to remove him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate repented of his threat, but there was now no remedy. He
motioned to his companions, who rose reluctantly, and all went out, not
without hostile glances toward Ibarra.</p>
<p>The whisperings and murmurs began again. Several people came up to
Cris&oacute;stomo and said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We are with you; pay no attention
to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; he asked in
astonishment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Those who have gone out because
you are here; they say you are excommunicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra, surprised, not knowing what to say, looked about him.
Maria&rsquo;s face was hidden.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it possible? Are we yet in the
middle ages?&rdquo; he began. But he checked himself and said to the
girls:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I must excuse myself; I will be
back to go home with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, stay!&rdquo; said Sinang.
&ldquo;Yeyeng is going to dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I cannot, little
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Yeyeng was coming forward, two soldiers of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4002" href="#xd21e4002" name=
"xd21e4002">170</a>]</span>guard approached Don Filipo and demanded
that the representation be stopped.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; he asked in
surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because the alf&eacute;rez and his
wife have been fighting; they want to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell the alf&eacute;rez we have
the permission of the alcalde of the province, and nobody in the pueblo
can overrule that, not even the gobernadorcillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But we have our orders to stop the
performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Filipo shrugged his shoulders and turned his back. The Comedy
Company of Tondo was about to give a play, and the audience was
settling for its enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Filipino is passionately fond of the theatre; he listens in
silence, never hisses, and applauds with measure. Does not the
spectacle please him? He chews his buyo and goes out quietly, not to
trouble those who may like it. He expects in his plays a combat every
fifteen seconds, and all the rest of the time repartee between comic
personages, or terrifying metamorphoses. The comedy chosen for this
f&ecirc;te was &ldquo;Prince Villardo, or the Nails Drawn from the
Cellar of Infamy,&rdquo; comedy with sorcery and fireworks.</p>
<p>Prince Villardo presented himself, defying the Moors, who held his
father prisoner. He threatened to cut off all their heads at a single
stroke and send them into the moon.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Moors, as they were preparing for the combat, a
tumult arose. The music stopped, and the musicians assailed the theatre
with their instruments, which went flying in all directions. The
valiant Villardo, unprepared for so many foes, threw down his sword and
buckler and took to flight, and the Moors, seeing the hasty leave of so
terrible a Christian, made bold to follow him. Cries, exclamations, and
imprecations rose on all sides, people ran against one another, lights
went out, children screamed, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4021" href="#xd21e4021" name="xd21e4021">171</a>]</span>benches
were overturned in a hurly-burly. Some cried fire, some cried
&ldquo;The tulisanes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What had happened? The two guards had driven off the musicians, and
the lieutenant and some of the cuadrilleros were vainly trying to check
their flight.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take those two men to the
tribunal!&rdquo; cried Don Filipo. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them
escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the crowd had recovered from its fright and taken account of
what had happened, indignation broke forth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they are
for!&rdquo; cried a woman, brandishing her arms; &ldquo;to trouble the
pueblo! They are the real tulisanes! Fire the barracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stones rained on the group of cuadrilleros leading off the guards,
and the cry to fire the barracks was repeated. Chananay in her costume
of Leonora in &ldquo;Il Trovatore&rdquo; was talking with Ratia, in
schoolmaster&rsquo;s dress; Yeyeng, wrapped in a shawl, was attended by
Prince Villardo, while the Moors tried to console the mortified
musicians; but already the crowd had determined upon action, and Don
Filipo was doing his best to hold them in check.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do nothing rash!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;To-morrow we will demand satisfaction; we shall have justice; I
promise you justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied some;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what they did at Calamba: they promised justice,
and the alcalde didn&rsquo;t do a thing! We will take justice for
ourselves! To the barracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Filipo, looking about for some one to aid him, saw Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake,
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, keep the people here while I go for the
cuadrilleros!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; demanded the
perplexed young fellow; but Don Filipo was already in the distance.</p>
<p>Ibarra, in his turn, looked about for aid, and saw Elias. He ran to
him, took him by the arm, and, speaking in Spanish, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4046" href="#xd21e4046" name=
"xd21e4046">172</a>]</span>begged him to do what he could for order.
The helmsman disappeared in the crowd. Animated discussions were heard,
and rapid questions; then, little by little, the mass began to dissolve
and to wear a less hostile attitude. It was time; the soldiers arrived
with bayonets fixed.</p>
<p>As Ibarra was about to enter his house that night a little man in
mourning, having a great scar on his left cheek, placed himself in
front of him and bowed humbly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;
asked Cris&oacute;stomo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, my name is
Jos&eacute;; I am the brother of the man killed this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Ibarra, &ldquo;I
assure you I am not insensible to your loss. What do you wish of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, I wish to know how
much you are going to pay my brother&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pay!&rdquo; repeated
Cris&oacute;stomo, not without annoyance. &ldquo;We will talk of this
again; come to me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But tell me simply what you will
give,&rdquo; insisted Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I tell you we will talk of it
another day, not now,&rdquo; said Ibarra, more impatiently.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! You think because we are
poor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra interrupted him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try my patience too
far,&rdquo; he said, moving on. Jos&eacute; looked after him with a
smile full of hatred.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is easy to see he is a grandson
of the man who exposed my father to the sun,&rdquo; he murmured between
his teeth. &ldquo;The same blood!&rdquo; Then in a changed tone he
added: &ldquo;But if you pay well&mdash;friends!&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="first">The f&ecirc;te was over, and the inhabitants of the
pueblo now perceived, as they did every year, that their purses were
empty, that in the sweat of their faces they had earned scant pleasure,
and paid dear for noise and headaches. But what of that? The next year
they would begin again; the next century it would still be the same,
for it had been so up to this time, and there is nothing which can make
people renounce a custom.</p>
<p>The house of Captain Tiago is sad. All the windows are closed; one
scarcely dares make a sound; and nowhere but in the kitchen do they
speak aloud. Maria Clara, the soul of the house, is sick in bed. The
state of her health could be read on all faces, as our actions betray
the griefs of our hearts.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What do you think, Isabel, ought I
to make a gift to the cross at Tunasan, or that at Matahong?&rdquo;
asks the unhappy father. &ldquo;The cross at Tunasan grows, but that at
Matahong perspires. Which do you call the more miraculous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Isabel reflected, nodded her head, and whispered:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To grow is more miraculous; we all
perspire, but we don&rsquo;t all grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, yes, Isabel; but,
after all, for wood to perspire&mdash;well, then, the best thing is to
make offerings to both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A carriage stopping before the house cut short the conversation.
Captain Tiago, followed by Aunt Isabel, ran down <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4093" href="#xd21e4093" name=
"xd21e4093">174</a>]</span>the steps to receive the coming guests. They
were the doctor, Don Tiburcio de Espada&ntilde;a, his wife, the Doctora
Do&ntilde;a Victorina de Los Reyes de de Espada&ntilde;a, and a young
Spaniard of attractive face and fine appearance.</p>
<p>The doctora wore a silk dress bordered with flowers, and a hat with
a large parrot perched among bows of red and blue ribbons. The dust of
the journey mingling with the rice powder on her cheeks, exaggerated
her wrinkles; as when we saw her at Manila, she had given her arm to
her lame husband.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have the pleasure of presenting
to you our cousin, Don Alfonso Linares de Espada&ntilde;a,&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, indicating the young man; &ldquo;the adopted son
of a relative of Father D&aacute;maso&rsquo;s, and private secretary of
all the ministers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man bowed low; Captain Tiago barely escaped kissing his
hand.</p>
<p>While the countless trunks, valises, and bags are being cared for
and Captain Tiago is conducting his guests to their apartments, let us
make a nearer acquaintance with these people whom we have not seen
since the opening chapters.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina is a woman of forty-five summers, which,
according to her arithmetic, are equivalent to thirty-two springs. In
her youth she had been very pretty, but, enraptured in her own
contemplation, she had looked with the utmost disdain on her numerous
Filipino adorers, even scorning the vows of love once murmured in her
ears or chanted under her balcony by Captain Tiago. Her aspirations
bore her toward another race.</p>
<p>Her first youth, then her second, then her third, having passed in
tending nets to catch in the ocean of the world the object of her
dreams, Do&ntilde;a Victorina must in the end content herself with what
fate willed her. It was a poor man <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4111" href="#xd21e4111" name="xd21e4111">175</a>]</span>torn from
his native Estramadure, who, after wandering six or seven years about
the world, a modern Ulysses, found at length, in the island of Luzon,
hospitality, money, and a faded Calypso.</p>
<p>Don Tiburcio was a modest man, without force, who would not
willingly have injured a fly. He started for the Philippines as
under-clerk of customs, but after breaking his leg was forced to give
up his position. For a while he lived at the expense of some
compatriots, but he found their bread bitter. As he had neither
profession nor money, his advisers counselled him to go into the
provinces and offer himself as a physician. At first he refused, but,
necessity becoming pressing, his friends convinced him of the vanity of
his scruples. He started out, kept by his conscience from asking more
than small fees, and was on the road to prosperity when a jealous
doctor called him to the attention of the College of Physicians at
Manila. Nothing would have come of it, but the affair reached the ears
of the people; loss of confidence followed, and then loss of patrons.
Misery again stared him in the face when he heard of the affliction of
Do&ntilde;a Victorina. Don Tiburcio saw here a patch of blue sky, and
asked to be presented.</p>
<p>They met, and after a half-hour of conversation, reached an
understanding. Without doubt she would have preferred a Spaniard less
halting, less bald, without impediment of speech, and with more teeth;
but such a Spaniard had never asked her hand, and at thirty-two what
woman is not prudent?</p>
<p>For his part, Don Tiburcio resigned himself when he saw the spectre
of famine raise its head. Not that he had ever had great ambitions or
great pretensions; but his heart, virgin till now, had pictured a
different divinity. He was, however, somewhat of a philosopher. He said
to himself: &ldquo;All that was a dream! Is the reality powdered and
wrinkled, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4119" href="#xd21e4119"
name="xd21e4119">176</a>]</span>homely and ridiculous? Well, I am bald
and lame and toothless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were married then, and Do&ntilde;a Victorina was enchanted with
her husband. She had him fitted out with false teeth, attired by the
best tailors of the city, and ordered carriages and horses for the
professional visits she intended him again to make.</p>
<p>While thus transforming her husband, she did not forget herself. She
discarded the silk skirt and jacket of pi&ntilde;a for European
costume, loaded her head with false hair, and her person with such
extravagances generally as to disturb the peace of a whole idle and
tranquil neighborhood.</p>
<p>The glamour around the husband first began to dim when he tried to
approach the subject of the rice powder by remarking that nothing is so
ugly as the false or so admirable as the natural. Do&ntilde;a Victorina
looked unpleasantly at his teeth, and he was silent. Indeed, at the end
of a very short time the doctora had arrived at the complete
subjugation of her husband, who no longer offered any more resistance
than a little lap-dog. If he did anything to annoy her, she forbade his
going out, and in her moments of greatest rage she tore out his false
teeth, and left him, sometimes for days, horribly disfigured.</p>
<p>When they were well settled in Manila, Rodoreda received orders to
engrave on a plate of black marble:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium xd21e107">&ldquo;Dr. De
Espada&ntilde;a,<br>
Specialist in All Kinds of Diseases.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you wish me to be put in
prison?&rdquo; asked Don Tiburcio in terror.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I wish people to call you doctor
and me doctora,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Victorina, &ldquo;but it must
be understood that you treat only very rare cases.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4140" href="#xd21e4140" name=
"xd21e4140">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd21e4143" title=
"Source: senora">se&ntilde;ora</span> signed her own name, Victorina de
los Reyes de de Espada&ntilde;a. Neither the engraver of her visiting
cards nor her husband could make her renounce that second
&ldquo;de.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I use only one
&lsquo;de,&rsquo; people will think you haven&rsquo;t any,
imbecile!&rdquo; she said to Don Tiburcio.</p>
<p>Then the number of gewgaws grew, the layer of rice powder was
thickened, the ribbons and laces were piled higher, and Do&ntilde;a
Victorina regarded with more and more disdain her poor compatriots who
had not had the fortune to marry husbands of so high estate as her
own.</p>
<p>All this sublimity, however, did not prevent her being each day
older and more ridiculous. Every time Captain Tiago was with her, and
remembered that she had once really inspired him with love, he sent a
peso to the church for a mass of thanksgiving. But he had much respect
for Don Tiburcio, because of his title of specialist, and listened
attentively to the rare sentences the doctor&rsquo;s impediment of
speech let him pronounce. For this reason and because the doctor did
not lavish his visits on people at large he had chosen him to treat
Maria.</p>
<p>As to young Linares, Do&ntilde;a Victorina, wishing a steward from
the peninsula, her husband remembered a cousin of his, a law student at
Madrid, who was considered the most astute of the family. They sent for
him, and the young man had just arrived.</p>
<p>Father Salvi entered while Don Santiago and his guests were at the
second breakfast. They talked of Maria Clara, who was sleeping; they
talked of the journey, and Do&ntilde;a Victorina exclaimed loudly at
the costumes of the provincials, their houses of nipa, and their bamboo
bridges. She did not omit to inform the curate of her friendly
relations with the &ldquo;Segundo Cabo,&rdquo; with this alcalde, with
that councillor, all people of distinction, who had for her the
greatest consideration. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4156" href=
"#xd21e4156" name="xd21e4156">178</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you had come two days earlier,
Do&ntilde;a Victorina,&rdquo; said Captain Tiago, profiting by a slight
pause in the lady&rsquo;s brilliant loquacity, &ldquo;you would have
found His Excellency the governor general seated in this very
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! His Excellency was here? And
at your house? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I repeat that he was seated
exactly here. If you had come two days ago&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! What a pity Clarita did not
fall ill sooner!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You hear, cousin! His
Excellency was here! You know, Don Santiago, that at Madrid our cousin
was the friend of ministers and dukes, and that he dined with the Count
del Campanario.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Duke de la Torre,
Victorina,&rdquo; suggested her husband.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is the same thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Shall I find Father D&aacute;maso
at his pueblo to-day?&rdquo; Linares asked Brother Salvi.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father D&aacute;maso is here, and
may be with us at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad! I have a
letter for him, and if a happy chance had not brought me here, I should
have come expressly to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the &ldquo;happy chance,&rdquo; that is to say, poor Maria
Clara, had awakened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come, de <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e4180" title="Source: Espa&ntilde;ada">Espada&ntilde;a</span>,
come, see Clarita,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Victorina. &ldquo;It is for
you he does this,&rdquo; she went on, turning to Captain Tiago;
&ldquo;my husband attends only people of quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick-room was almost in obscurity, the windows closed, for fear
of draughts; two candles, burning before an image of the Virgin of
Antipolo, sent out feeble glimmers.</p>
<p>Enveloped in multiple folds of white, the lovely figure of Maria lay
on her bed of kamagon, behind curtains of jusi <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4187" href="#xd21e4187" name=
"xd21e4187">179</a>]</span>and pi&ntilde;a. Her abundant hair about her
face increased its transparent pallor, as did the radiance of her
great, sad eyes. Beside her were her two friends, and Andeng holding a
lily branch.</p>
<p>De Espada&ntilde;a felt her pulse, examined her tongue, asked a
question or two, and nodded his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium"><span class="corr" id="xd21e4193" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Sh&mdash;she is s&mdash;sick, but she can
be c&mdash;cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina looked proudly at their audience.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium"><span class="corr" id="xd21e4199" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Lichen with m&mdash;m&mdash;milk, for the
m&mdash;m&mdash;morning, syrup of m&mdash;m&mdash;marshmallow, and two
tablets of cynoglossum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take courage, Clarita,&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, approaching the bed, &ldquo;we have come to cure
you. I&rsquo;m going to present to you our cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Linares, absorbed, was gazing at those eloquent eyes, which seemed
to be searching for some one; he did not hear Do&ntilde;a
Victorina.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Linares,&rdquo; said
the curate, drawing him out of his abstraction, &ldquo;here is Father
D&aacute;maso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed he; but it was not the Father D&aacute;maso of
heretofore, so vigorous and alert. He walked uncertainly, and he was
pale and sad. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4210" href=

<p class="first">With no word for any one else, Father D&aacute;maso
went straight to Maria&rsquo;s bed and took her hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; he said with great
tenderness, and tears gushed from his eyes, &ldquo;Maria, my child, you
must not die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara looked at him with some astonishment. No one of those
who knew the Franciscan would have believed him capable of such display
of feeling.</p>
<p>He could not say another word, but moved aside the draperies and
went out among the plants of Maria&rsquo;s balcony, crying like a
child.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How he loves his
god-daughter!&rdquo; every one thought.</p>
<p>Father Salvi, motionless and silent, watched him intently.</p>
<p>When the father&rsquo;s grief seemed more controlled, Do&ntilde;a
Victorino presented young Linares. Father D&aacute;maso, saying
nothing, looked him over from head to foot, took the letter, read it
without appearing to comprehend, and asked:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Alfonso Linares, the godson of
your brother-in-law&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; stammered the young fellow.
Father D&aacute;maso threw back his head and examined him anew, his
face clearing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! It&rsquo;s the godson of
Carlicos!&rdquo; he cried, clasping him in his arms. &ldquo;I had a
letter from him some days ago. And it is you? You were not born when I
left the country. I did not know you!&rdquo; And Father D&aacute;maso
still held in his strong arms the young man, whose face began to color,
perhaps from embarrassment, perhaps from suffocation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4237" href="#xd21e4237" name=
"xd21e4237">181</a>]</span>Father D&aacute;maso appeared to have
completely forgotten his grief.</p>
<p>After the first moments of effusion and questions about Carlicos and
Pepa, Father D&aacute;maso asked:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, what is it
Carlicos wishes me to do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I think he says something about it
in the letter,&rdquo; stammered Linares again.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the letter? Yes, that&rsquo;s
so! He wishes me to find you employment and a wife. Ah, the employment
is easy enough, but as for the wife!&mdash;hem!&mdash;a
wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father, that is not so
urgent,&rdquo; said Linares, with confusion.</p>
<p>But Father D&aacute;maso was walking back and forth murmuring:
&ldquo;A wife! A wife!&rdquo; His face was no longer sad or joyful, but
serious and preoccupied. From a distance Father Salvi watched the
scene.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I did not think the thing could
cause me so much pain,&rdquo; Father D&aacute;maso murmured
plaintively; &ldquo;but of two evils choose the least!&rdquo; Then
approaching Linares:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come with me, my boy,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;we will talk with Don Santiago.&rdquo; Linares paled and
followed the priest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4255" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long days followed by weary nights were passed by the
pillow of the sick girl. After a confession to Father Salvi, Maria
Clara had had a relapse, and in her delirium she pronounced no name but
that of her mother, whom she had never known. Her friends, her father,
her aunt, watched her, and heaped with gifts and with silver for masses
the altars of miraculous images. At last, slowly and regularly, the
fever began to abate.</p>
<p>The Doctor de Espada&ntilde;a was stupefied at the virtues of the
syrup of marshmallow and the decoction of lichen, prescriptions he had
never varied. Do&ntilde;a Victorina was so satisfied with her husband
that one day when he stepped on her train, in a rare state of clemency
she did not apply to him the usual penal code by pulling out his
teeth.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Sinang and Victorina were with Maria; the curate,
Captain Tiago, and the Espada&ntilde;as were talking in the
dining-room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m distressed to hear
it,&rdquo; the doctor was saying; &ldquo;and Father D&aacute;maso must
be greatly disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where did you say he is to be
sent?&rdquo; asked Linares.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Into the province of
Tabayas,&rdquo; replied the curate carelessly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria Clara will be very sorry
too,&rdquo; said Captain Tiago; &ldquo;she loves him like a
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Salvi looked at him from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; continued Captain
Tiago, &ldquo;I believe her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4279"
href="#xd21e4279" name="xd21e4279">183</a>]</span>sickness came from
nothing but that trouble the day of the f&ecirc;te.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am of the same opinion, so you
have done well in not permitting Se&ntilde;or Ibarra to talk with her;
that would only have aggravated her condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And it is thanks to us
alone,&rdquo; interrupted Do&ntilde;a Victorina, &ldquo;that Clarita is
not already in heaven singing praises with the angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; Captain Tiago felt
moved to say.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I think I know whereof I
speak,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;when I say that the confession of
Maria Clara brought about the favorable crisis that saved her life. I
do not deny the power of science, but a pure
conscience&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; objected
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, piqued; &ldquo;then cure the wife of the
alf&eacute;rez with a confession!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A hurt, se&ntilde;ora, is not a
malady, to be influenced by the conscience,&rdquo; replied Father Salvi
severely; &ldquo;but a good confession would preserve her in future
from such blows as she got this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She deserved them!&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina. &ldquo;She is an insolent woman. In church she
did nothing but look at me. I had a mind to ask her what there was
curious about my face; but who would soil her lips speaking to these
people of no standing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate, as if he had not heard this tirade, continued: &ldquo;To
finish the cure of your daughter, she should receive the communion
to-morrow, Don Santiago. I think she does not need to confess, and yet,
if she will once more, this evening&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, profiting by the pause to continue her
reflections, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how men can marry such
frights. One easily sees where that woman came from. She is dying of
envy, that shows in her eyes. What does an alf&eacute;rez get?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4300" href="#xd21e4300" name=
"xd21e4300">184</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So prepare Maria for
confession,&rdquo; the curate continued, turning to Aunt Isabel.</p>
<p>The good aunt left the group and went to her niece&rsquo;s room.
Maria Clara was still in bed, and pale, very pale; beside her were her
two friends.</p>
<p>Sinang was giving her her medicine.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He has not written to you
again?&rdquo; asked Maria, softly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He gave you no message for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; he only said he was going to
make every effort to have the archbishop raise the ban of
excommunication&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrival of Aunt Isabel interrupted the conversation.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The father says you are to prepare
yourself for confession, my child,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Sinang,
leave her to examine her conscience. Shall I bring you the
&lsquo;Anchor,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Bouquet,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Straight
Road to Heaven,&rsquo; Maria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara did not reply.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, we mustn&rsquo;t fatigue
you,&rdquo; said the good aunt consolingly; &ldquo;I will read you the
examination myself, and you will only have to remember your
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Write him to think of me no
more,&rdquo; murmured the sick girl in Sinang&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Aunt Isabel came back with her book, and Sinang had to go.</p>
<p>The good aunt drew her chair up to the light, settled her glasses on
the tip of her nose, and opened a little book.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Give good attention, my child: I
will begin with the commandments of God; I shall go slowly, so that you
may meditate: if you don&rsquo;t hear well, you must tell me, and I
will repeat; you know I&rsquo;m never weary of working for your
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a voice monotonous and nasal, she began to read. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4337" href="#xd21e4337" name=
"xd21e4337">185</a>]</span>Maria Clara gazed vaguely into space. The
first commandment finished, Aunt Isabel observed her listener over her
glasses, and appeared satisfied with her sad and meditative air. She
coughed piously, and after a long pause began the second. The good old
woman read with unction. The terms of the second commandment finished,
she again looked at her niece, who slowly turned away her head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Aunt Isabel
within herself, &ldquo;as to taking His holy name in vain, the poor
thing has nothing to question: pass on to the third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the third commandment sifted and commentated, all the causes of
sin against it droned out, she again looked toward the bed. This time
she lifted her glasses and rubbed her eyes; she had seen her niece
raise her handkerchief, as if to wipe away tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;hm!
the poor child must have fallen asleep during the sermon.&rdquo; And
putting back her glasses on the tip of her nose, she reflected:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall see if besides not
keeping the holy feast days, she has not honored her father and her
mother.&rdquo; And slowly, in a voice more nasal than ever, she read
the fourth commandment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a pure soul!&rdquo; thought
the old lady; &ldquo;she who is so obedient, so submissive! I&rsquo;ve
sinned much more deeply than that, and I&rsquo;ve never been able to
really cry!&rdquo; And she began the fifth commandment with such
enthusiasm that she did not hear the stifled sobs of her niece. It was
only when she stopped after the commentaries on wilful homicide, that
she perceived the groanings of the sinner. Then in a voice that passed
description, and a manner she strove to make menacing, she finished the
commentary, and seeing that Maria had not ceased to weep:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cry, my child, cry!&rdquo; she
said, going to her bedside; &ldquo;the more you cry the more quickly
will God pardon you. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4351" href=
"#xd21e4351" name="xd21e4351">186</a>]</span>Cry, my child, cry; and
beat your breast, but not too hard, for you are ill yet, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as if grief had need of mystery and solitude, Maria Clara,
finding herself surprised, stopped sobbing little by little and dried
her eyes. Aunt Isabel returned to her reading, but the plaint of her
audience having ceased, she lost her enthusiasm; the second table of
the law made her sleepy, and a yawn broke the nasal monotony.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No one would have believed it
without seeing it,&rdquo; thought the good woman; &ldquo;the child sins
like a soldier against the first five commandments, and from the sixth
to the tenth not so much as a peccadillo. That is contrary to the
custom of the rest of us. One sees queer things in these days!&rdquo;
And she lighted a great candle for the Virgin of Antipolo, and two
smaller ones for Our Lady of the Rosary and Our Lady of the Pillar. The
Virgin of Delaroche was excluded from this illumination: she was to
Aunt Isabel an unknown foreigner.</p>
<p>We may not know what passed during the confession in the evening. It
was long, and Aunt Isabel, who at a distance was watching over her
niece, could see that instead of offering his ear to the sick girl, the
curate had his face turned toward her. He went out, pale, with
compressed lips. At the sight of his brow, darkened and moist with
sweat, one would have said it was he who had confessed, and absolution
had been denied him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria! Joseph!&rdquo; said the
good aunt, crossing herself, &ldquo;who can comprehend the girls of
to-day!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4362" href=

<h2 class="label">XXXVIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Two Women.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Do&ntilde;a Victorina was taking a walk through the
pueblo, to see of what sort were the dwellings and the advancement of
the indolent Indians. She had put on her most elegant adornments, to
impress the provincials, and to show what distance separated them from
her sacred person. Giving her arm to her limping husband, she paraded
the streets of the pueblo, to the profound amazement of its
inhabitants.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What ugly houses these Indians
have!&rdquo; she began, with a grimace. &ldquo;One must needs be an
Indian to live in them! And how ill-bred the people are! They pass us
without uncovering. Knock off their hats, as the curates do, and the
lieutenants of the Civil Guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if they attack me?&rdquo;
stammered the doctor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you not a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;but&mdash;I am
lame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina grew cross. There were no sidewalks in these
streets, and the dust was soiling the train of her dress. Some young
girls who passed dropped their eyes, and did not admire at all as they
should her luxurious attire. Sinang&rsquo;s coachman, who was driving
Sinang and her cousin in an elegant tres-por-ciento, had the effrontery
to cry out to her &ldquo;Tabi!&rdquo; in so audacious a voice that she
moved out of the way.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a brute of a coachman!&rdquo;
she protested; &ldquo;I shall tell his master he had better train his
servants. Come along, Tiburcio!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4382" href="#xd21e4382" name="xd21e4382">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>Her husband, fearing a tempest, turned on his heels, and they found
themselves face to face with the alf&eacute;rez. Greetings were
exchanged, but Do&ntilde;a Victorina&rsquo;s discontent grew. Not only
had the officer said nothing complimentary of her costume, but she
believed she detected mockery in his look.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You ought not to give your hand to
a simple alf&eacute;rez,&rdquo; she said to her husband, when the
officer had passed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to preserve your
rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;H&mdash;here he is the
chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What does that mean to us? Do we
happen to be Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Don
Tiburcio, not minded to dispute.</p>
<p>They passed the barracks. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion was at the window,
as usual dressed in flannel, and puffing her puro. As the house was
low, the two women faced each other. The muse examined Do&ntilde;a
Victorina from head to foot, protruded her lip, ejected tobacco juice,
and turned away her head. This affectation of contempt brought the
patience of the doctora to an end. Leaving her husband without support,
she went, trembling with rage, powerless to utter a word, and placed
herself in front of the alf&eacute;reza&rsquo;s window. Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion turned her head slowly back, regarded her antagonist with
the utmost calm, and spat again with the same cool contempt.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you,
do&ntilde;a?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Could you tell me, se&ntilde;ora,
why you stare at me in this fashion? Are you jealous?&rdquo;
Do&ntilde;a Victorina was at last able to say.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I jealous? And of you?&rdquo;
replied the alf&eacute;reza calmly. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m jealous of
your frizzes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come away there!&rdquo; broke in
the doctor; &ldquo;d&mdash;d&mdash;don&rsquo;t pay
at&mdash;t&mdash;t&mdash;tention to these
f&mdash;f&mdash;follies!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let me alone! I have to give a
lesson to this brazenface!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4406" href="#xd21e4406" name="xd21e4406">189</a>]</span>replied
the doctora, joggling her husband, who just missed sprawling in the
dust.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Consider to whom you are
speaking!&rdquo; she said haughtily, turning back to Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am a provincial or a woman of
your class. With us, at Manila, the alf&eacute;rezas are not received;
they wait at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ho! ho! most worshipful
se&ntilde;ora, the alf&eacute;rezas wait at the door! But you receive
such paralytics as this gentleman! Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she been less powdered Do&ntilde;a Victorina might have been
seen to blush. She started to rush on her enemy, but the sentinel stood
in the way. The street was filling with a curious crowd.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Know that I demean myself in
speaking to you; persons of position like me ought not! Will you wash
my clothes? I will pay you well. Do you suppose I do not know you are a
washerwoman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Consolacion sat erect. To be called a washerwoman had
wounded her.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And do you think we don&rsquo;t
know who you are?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;My husband has told me!
Se&ntilde;ora, I, at least&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she could not be heard. Do&ntilde;a Victorina, wildly shaking
her fists, screamed out:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come down, you old hussy, come
down and let me tear your beautiful eyes out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly the medusa disappeared from the window; more rapidly yet she
came running down the steps, brandishing her husband&rsquo;s terrible
whip. Don Tiburcio, supplicating both, threw himself between, but he
could not have prevented the combat, had not the alf&eacute;rez
arrived.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, well,
se&ntilde;oras!&mdash;Don Tiburcio!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Give your wife a little more
breeding, buy her more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4431" href=
"#xd21e4431" name="xd21e4431">190</a>]</span>beautiful clothes, and if
you haven&rsquo;t the money, steal it from the people of the pueblo;
you have soldiers for that!&rdquo; cried Do&ntilde;a Victorina.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; said the
alf&eacute;rez, furious, &ldquo;it is fortunate that I remember you are
a woman; if I didn&rsquo;t, I should trample you down, with all your
curls and ribbons!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&mdash;se&ntilde;or
alf&eacute;rez!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Move on, charlatan! It&rsquo;s not
you who wear the breeches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed with words and gestures, with cries, insults, and injuries,
the two women hurled at each other all there was in them of soil and
shame. All four talked at once, and in the multitude of words numerous
verities were paraded in the light. If they did not hear all, the crowd
of the curious did not fail to be diverted. They were looking forward
to battle, but, unhappily for these amateurs of sport, the curate came
by and established peace.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;oras! se&ntilde;oras!
what a scandal! Se&ntilde;or alf&eacute;rez!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you doing here,
hypocrite, carlist!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Tiburcio, take away your wife!
Se&ntilde;ora, restrain your tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little by little the dictionary of sounding epithets became
exhausted. The shameless shrews found nothing left to say to each
other, and still threatening, the two couples drew slowly apart, the
curate going from one to the other, lavishing himself on both.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall leave for Manila this
very day and present ourselves to the captain-general!&rdquo; said the
infuriated Do&ntilde;a Victorina to her husband. &ldquo;You are no
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But&mdash;but, wife, the guards,
and I am lame.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are to challenge him, with
swords or pistols, or else&mdash;or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And she
looked at his teeth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Woman, I&rsquo;ve never
handled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Victorina let him go no farther; with a sublime
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4460" href="#xd21e4460" name=
"xd21e4460">191</a>]</span>movement she snatched out his teeth, threw
them in the dust, and trampled them under her feet. The doctor almost
crying, the doctora pelting him with sarcasms, they arrived at the
house of Captain Tiago. Linares, who was talking with Maria Clara, was
no little disquieted by the abrupt arrival of his cousins. Maria, amid
the pillows of her fauteuil, was not less surprised at the new
physiognomy of her doctor.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a
Victorina, &ldquo;you are to go and challenge the alf&eacute;rez this
instant; if not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded the
astonished Linares.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are to go and challenge him
this instant; if not, I shall say here, and to everybody, who you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Victorina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three friends looked at each other.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The alf&eacute;rez has insulted
us. The old sorceress came down with a whip to assault us, and this
creature did nothing to prevent it! A man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hear that!&rdquo; said Sinang
regretfully. &ldquo;There was a fight, and we didn&rsquo;t see
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The alf&eacute;rez broke the
doctor&rsquo;s teeth!&rdquo; added Do&ntilde;a Victorina.</p>
<p>Captain Tiago entered, but he wasn&rsquo;t given time to get his
breath. In few words, with an intermingling of spicy language,
Do&ntilde;a Victorina narrated what had passed, naturally trying to put
herself in a good light.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Linares is going to challenge him,
do you hear? Or don&rsquo;t let him marry your daughter. If he
isn&rsquo;t courageous, he doesn&rsquo;t merit Clarita.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! you are going to marry this
gentleman?&rdquo; Sinang asked Maria, her laughing eyes filling with
tears. &ldquo;I know you are discreet, but I didn&rsquo;t think you
inconstant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara, white as alabaster, looked with great, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4488" href="#xd21e4488" name=
"xd21e4488">192</a>]</span>frightened eyes from her father to
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, from Do&ntilde;a Victorina to Linares. The young
man reddened; Captain Tiago dropped his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Help me to my room,&rdquo; Maria
said to her friends, and steadied by their round arms, her head on the
shoulder of Victorina, she went out.</p>
<p>That night the husband and wife packed their trunks, and presented
their account&mdash;no trifle&mdash;to Captain Tiago. The next morning
they set out for Manila, leaving to the pacific Linares the r&ocirc;le
of avenger. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4494" href="#xd21e4494"

<h2 class="main">The Outlawed.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By the feeble moonlight that penetrates the thick
foliage of forest trees, a man was making his way through the woods.
His movement was slow but assured. From time to time, as if to get his
bearings, he whistled an air, to which another whistler in the distance
replied by repeating it.</p>
<p>At last, after struggling long against the many obstacles a virgin
forest opposes to the march of man, and most obstinately at night, he
arrived at a little clearing, bathed in the light of the moon in its
first quarter. Scarcely had he entered it when another man came
carefully out from behind a great rock, a revolver in his hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded
with authority in Tagalo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is old Pablo with you?&rdquo;
asked the newcomer tranquilly; &ldquo;if so, tell him Elias is
searching for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are Elias?&rdquo; said the
other, with a certain respect, yet keeping his revolver cocked.
&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They penetrated a cavern, the guide warning the helmsman when to
lower his head, when to crawl on all fours. After a short passage they
arrived at a sort of room, dimly lighted by pitch torches, where twelve
or fifteen men, dirty, ragged, and sinister, were talking low among
themselves. His elbows resting on a stone, an old man of sombre face
sat apart, looking toward the smoky torches. It was a cavern of
tulisanes. When Elias arrived, the men started <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4512" href="#xd21e4512" name=
"xd21e4512">194</a>]</span>to rise, but at a gesture from the old man
they remained quiet, contenting themselves with examining the
newcomer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it thou, then?&rdquo; said the
old chief, his sad eyes lighting a little at sight of the young
man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you are here!&rdquo; exclaimed
Elias, half to himself.</p>
<p>The old man bent his head in silence, making at the same time a sign
to the men, who rose and went out, not without taking the
helmsman&rsquo;s measure with their eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man to
Elias when they were alone, &ldquo;six months ago I gave you
hospitality in my home; now it is I who receive compassion from you.
But sit down and tell me how you found me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As soon as I heard of your
misfortunes,&rdquo; replied Elias slowly, &ldquo;I set out, and
searched from mountain to mountain. I&rsquo;ve gone over nearly two
provinces.&rdquo; After a short pause in which he tried to read the old
man&rsquo;s thoughts in his sombre face, he went on:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have come to make you a
proposition. After vainly trying to find some representative of the
family which caused the ruin of my own, I have decided to go North, and
live among the savage tribes. Will you leave this life you are
beginning, and come with me? Let me be a son to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;At my age,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;when one has taken a desperate resolution it is final. When such
a man as I, who passed his youth and ripe age laboring to assure his
future and that of his children, who submitted always to the will of
superiors, whose conscience is clear&mdash;when such a man, almost on
the border of the tomb, renounces all his past, it is because after
ripe reflection he concludes that there is no such thing as peace. Why
go to a strange land to drag out my miserable days? I had two sons, a
daughter, a home, a fortune. I enjoyed consideration and respect; now I
am like a tree stripped of its branches, bare and desolate. And
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4531" href="#xd21e4531" name=
"xd21e4531">195</a>]</span>why? Because a man dishonored my daughter;
because my sons wished to seek satisfaction from this man, placed above
other by his office; because this man, fearing them, sought their
destruction and accomplished it. And I have survived; but if I did not
know how to defend my sons, I shall know how to avenge them. The day my
band is strong enough, I shall go down into the plain and wipe out my
vengeance and my life in fire! Either this day will come or there is no
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man rose, and, his eyes glittering, his voice cavernous, he
cried, fastening his hands in his long hair:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Malediction, malediction upon me,
who held the avenging hands of my sons! I was their
assassin!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said
Elias; &ldquo;I too have a vengeance to satisfy; and yet, from fear of
striking the innocent, I choose to forego that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You can; you are young; you have
not lost your last hope. I too, I swear it, would not strike the
innocent. You see this wound? I got it rather than harm a cuadrillero
who was doing his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Elias,
&ldquo;if you carry out your purpose, you will bring dreadful woes to
our unhappy country. If with your own hands you satisfy your vengeance,
your enemies will take terrible reprisals&mdash;not from you, not from
those who are armed, but from the people, who are always the ones
accused. When I knew you in other days, you gave me wise counsels: will
you permit me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man crossed his arms and seemed to attend.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; continued
Elias, &ldquo;I have had the fortune to do a great service to a young
man, rich, kind of heart, upright, wishing the good of his country. It
is said he has relations at Madrid; of that I know nothing, but I know
he is the friend of the governor-general. What do you think of
interesting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4548" href="#xd21e4548"
name="xd21e4548">196</a>]</span>him in the cause of the miserable and
making him their voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is rich, you say. The rich
think only of increasing their riches. Not one of them would compromise
his peace to go to the aid of those who suffer. I know it, I who was
rich myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But he is not like the others. And
he is a young man about to marry, who wishes the tranquillity of his
country for the sake of his children&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is a man, then, who is going to
be happy. Our cause is not that of fortunate men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, but it is that of men of
courage!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the old man,
seating himself again. &ldquo;Let us suppose he consents to be our
mouthpiece. Let us suppose he wins the captain-general, and finds at
Madrid deputies who can plead for us; do you believe we shall have
justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us try it before we try
measures of blood,&rdquo; said Elias. &ldquo;It must surprise you that
I, an outlaw too, and young and strong, propose pacific measures. It is
because I see the number of miseries which we ourselves cause, as well
as our tyrants. It is always the unarmed who pay the
penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if nothing result from our
steps?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If we are not heard, if our
grievances are made light of, I shall be the first to put myself under
your orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man embraced Elias, a strange light in his eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I accept the proposition,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;I know you will keep your word. I will help you to
avenge your parents; you shall help me to avenge my sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Meanwhile, se&ntilde;or, you will
do nothing violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And you will set forth the wrongs
of the people; you know them. When shall I have the response?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4577" href="#xd21e4577" name=
"xd21e4577">197</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In four days send me a man to the
lake shore of San Diego. I will tell him the decision, and name the
person on whom I count.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Elias will be chief when Captain
Pablo is fallen,&rdquo; said the old man. And he himself accompanied
the helmsman out of the cave. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4582"

<h2 class="main">The Enigma.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The day after the departure of the doctor and the
doctora, Ibarra returned to the pueblo. He hastened to the house of
Captain Tiago to tell Maria he had been reconciled to the Church. Aunt
Isabel, who was fond of the young fellow, and anxious for his marriage
with her niece, was filled with joy. Captain Tiago was not at home.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; Aunt Isabel cried
in her bad Castilian. &ldquo;Maria, Cris&oacute;stomo has returned to
favor with the Church; the <span class="corr" id="xd21e4592" title=
"Source: archibshop">archbishop</span> has disexcommunicated
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But <span class="corr" id="xd21e4597" title=
"Source: Cris&ograve;stomo">Cris&oacute;stomo</span> stood still, the
smile froze on his lips, the words he was to say to Maria fled from his
mind. Leaning against the balcony beside her was Linares; on the floor
lay leafless roses and sampagas. The Spaniard was making garlands with
the flowers and leaves from the vines; Maria Clara, buried in her
fauteuil, pale and thoughtful, was playing with an ivory fan, less
white than her slender hands.</p>
<p>At sight of Ibarra Linares paled, and carmine tinted the cheeks of
Maria Clara. She tried to rise, but was not strong enough; she lowered
her eyes and let her fan fall.</p>
<p>For some seconds there was an embarrassing silence; then Ibarra
spoke.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have this moment arrived, and
came straight here. You are better than I thought you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would have said Maria had become mute: her eyes still lowered,
she did not say a word in reply. Ibarra looked searchingly at Linares;
the timid young man bore the scrutiny with haughtiness. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4608" href="#xd21e4608" name=
"xd21e4608">199</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I see my arrival was not
expected,&rdquo; he went on slowly. &ldquo;Pardon me, Maria, that I did
not have myself announced. Some day I can explain to you&mdash;for we
shall still see each other&mdash;surely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these last words the girl raised toward her fianc&eacute; her
beautiful eyes full of purity and sadness, so suppliant and so sweet
that Ibarra stood still in confusion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May I come to-morrow?&rdquo; he
asked after a moment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know that to me you are always
welcome,&rdquo; she said in a weak voice.</p>
<p>Ibarra left, calm in appearance, but a tempest was in his brain and
freezing cold in his heart. What he had just seen and comprehended
seemed to him incomprehensible. Was it doubt, inconstancy,
betrayal?</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, woman!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Without knowing where he went, he arrived at the ground where the
school was going up. Se&ntilde;or Juan hailed him with delight, and
showed him what had been done since he went away.</p>
<p>With surprise Ibarra saw Elias among the workmen; the helmsman
saluted him, as did the others, and at the same time made him
understand that he had something to say to him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Juan,&rdquo; said
Ibarra, &ldquo;will you bring me the list of workmen?&rdquo;
Se&ntilde;or Juan disappeared, and Ibarra approached Elias, who was
lifting a great stone and loading it on a cart.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you can, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
said the helmsman, &ldquo;give me an hour of conversation, there is
something grave of which I want to talk with you. Will you go on the
lake early this evening in my boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra gave a sign of assent and Elias moved away. Se&ntilde;or Juan
brought the list, but Ibarra searched it in vain for the name of the
helmsman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4632" href="#xd21e4632"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sun was just setting when Ibarra stepped into the
little boat on the lake shore. He appeared disturbed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Pardon me, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
said Elias, &ldquo;for having asked this favor; I wished to speak to
you freely, with no possibility of listeners.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what have you to
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had already shot away from the bank. The sun had disappeared
behind the crest of the mountains, and as twilight is of short duration
in this latitude, the night was descending rapidly, lighted by a
brilliant moon.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied
Elias, &ldquo;I am the spokesman of many unfortunates.&rdquo; And
briefly he told of his conversation with the chief of the tulisanes,
omitting the old man&rsquo;s doubts and threats.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And they wish?&rdquo; asked
Ibarra, when he had finished.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Radical reforms in the guard, the
clergy, and the administration of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; said Ibarra,
&ldquo;I know little of you, but I believe you will understand me when
I say that though I have friends at Madrid whom I might influence, and
though I might interest the captain-general in these people, neither
they nor he could bring about such a revolution. And more, I would not
take a step in this direction, because I believe what you want reformed
is at present a necessary evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You also, se&ntilde;or, believe in
necessary evil?&rdquo; said Elias <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4656" href="#xd21e4656" name="xd21e4656">201</a>]</span>with a
tremor in his voice. &ldquo;You think one must go through evil to
arrive at good?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; but I look at evil as a
violent remedy we sometimes use to cure ourselves of
illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is a bad medicine,
se&ntilde;or, that does away with the symptoms without searching out
the cause of the disease. The Municipal Guard exists only to suppress
crime by force and terrorizing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The institution may be imperfect,
but the terror it inspires keeps down the number of
criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Rather say that this terror
creates new criminals every day,&rdquo; said Elias. &ldquo;There are
those who have become tulisanes for life. A first offence punished
inhumanly, and the fear of further torture separates them forever from
society and condemns them to kill or to be killed. The terrorism of the
Municipal Guard shuts the doors of repentance, and as a tulisan,
defending himself in the mountains, fights to much better advantage
than the soldier he mocks, we cannot remedy the evil we have made.
Terrorism may serve when a people is enslaved, and the mountains have
no caverns; but when a desperate man feels the strength of his arm, and
anger possesses him, terrorism cannot put out the fire for which it has
itself heaped the fuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You would seem to speak
reasonably, Elias, if one had not already his own convictions. But let
me ask you, Who demand these reforms? You know I except you, whom I
cannot class with these others; but are they not all criminals, or men
ready to become so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go from pueblo to pueblo,
se&ntilde;or, from house to house, and listen to the stifled groanings,
and you will find that if you think that, you are mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But the Government must have a
body of unlimited power, to make itself respected and its authority
felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is true, se&ntilde;or, when the
Government is at war with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4675"
href="#xd21e4675" name="xd21e4675">202</a>]</span>the country; but is
it not unfortunate that in times of peace the people should be made to
feel they are at strife with their rulers? If, however, we prefer force
to authority, we should at least be careful to whom we give unlimited
power. Such a force in the hands of men ignorant, passionate, without
moral training or tried honor, is a weapon thrown to a madman in the
middle of an unarmed crowd. I grant the Government must have an arm,
but let it choose this arm well; and since it prefers the power it
assumes to that the people might give it, let it at least show that it
knows how to assume it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias spoke with passion; his eyes were brilliant, his voice was
resonant. His words were followed by silence; the boat, no longer
driven forward by the oars, seemed motionless on the surface of the
lake; the moon shone resplendent in the sapphire sky; above the far
banks the stars glittered.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what else do they
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Reform of the religious
orders,&mdash;they demand better protection&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Against the religious
orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Against their oppression,
se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do the Philippines forget the debt
they owe those men who led them out of error into the true faith? It is
a pity we are not taught the history of our country!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We must not forget this debt, no!
But were not our nationality and independence a dear price with which
to cancel it? We have also given the priests our best pueblos, our most
fertile fields, and we still give them our savings, for the purchase of
all sorts of religious objects. I realize that a pure faith and a
veritable love of humanity moved the first missionaries who came to our
shores. I acknowledge the debt we owe those noble men; I know that in
those days Spain abounded in heroes, of politics as well as religion.
But because the ancestors were true men, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4692" href="#xd21e4692" name="xd21e4692">203</a>]</span>must we
consent to the excesses of their unworthy descendants? Because a great
good has been done us, may we not protest against being done a great
wrong? The missionaries conquered the country, it is true; but do you
think it is through the monks that Spain will keep the
Philippines?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, and through them only. It is
the opinion of all those who have written on the islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Elias in
dejection, &ldquo;I thank you for your patience. I will take you back
to the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ibarra, &ldquo;go
on; we should know which is right in so important a
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will excuse me,
se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Elias, &ldquo;I have not eloquence enough to
convince you. If I have some education, I am an Indian, and my words
would always be suspected. Those who have expressed opinions contrary
to mine are Spaniards, and as such disarm in advance all contradiction.
Besides, when I see that you, who love your country, you, whose father
sleeps below this calm water, you who have been attacked and wronged
yourself, have these opinions, I commence to doubt my own convictions,
I acknowledge that the people may be mistaken. I must tell these
unfortunates who have placed their confidence in men to put it in God
or in their own strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Elias, your words hurt me, and
make me, too, have doubts. I have not grown up with the people, and
cannot know their needs. I only know what books have taught me. If I
take your words with caution, it is because I fear you may be
prejudiced by your personal wrongs. If I could know something of your
story, perhaps it would alter my judgment. I am mistrustful of
theories, am guided rather by facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias thought a moment, then he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If this is so, se&ntilde;or, I
will briefly tell you my history.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Family of Elias.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is about sixty years
since my grandfather was employed as accountant by a Spanish merchant.
Although still young, he was married, and had a son. One night the
warehouse took fire, and was burned with the surrounding property. The
loss was great, incendiarism was suspected, and my grandfather was
accused. He had no money to pay for his defence, and he was convicted
and condemned to be publicly flogged in the streets of his pueblo.
Attached to a horse, he was beaten as he passed each street corner by
men, his brothers. The curates, you know, advocate nothing but blows
for the discipline of the Indian. When the unhappy man, marked forever
with infamy, was liberated, his poor young wife went about seeking work
to keep alive her disabled husband and their little child. Failing in
this, she was forced to see them suffer, or to live herself a life of
shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra rose to his feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be disturbed!
There was no longer honor or dishonor for her or hers. When the
husband&rsquo;s wounds were healed, they went to hide themselves in the
mountains, where they lived for a time, shunned and feared. But my
grandfather, less courageous than his wife, could not endure this
existence and hung himself. When his body was found, by chance, my
grandmother was accused for not reporting his death, and was in turn
condemned to be flogged; but in consideration of her state her
punishment was deferred. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4720" href=
"#xd21e4720" name="xd21e4720">205</a>]</span>She gave birth to another
son, unhappily sound and strong; two months later her sentence was
carried out. Then she took her two children and fled into a neighboring
province.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium"><span class="corr" id="xd21e4723" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The elder of the sons remembered that he
had once been happy. As soon as he was old enough he became a tulisan
to avenge his wrongs, and the name of B&acirc;lat spread terror in many
provinces. The younger son, endowed by nature with a gentle
disposition, stayed with his mother, both living on the fruits of the
forest and dressing in the cast-off rags of those charitable enough to
give. At length the famous B&acirc;lat fell into the hands of justice,
and paid a dreadful penalty for his crimes, to that society which had
never done anything to teach him better than to commit them. One
morning the young brother, who had been in the forest gathering fruits,
came back to find the dead body of his mother in front of their cabin,
the horror-stricken eyes staring upward; and following them with his
own, the unhappy boy saw suspended from a limb the bloody head of his
brother.<span class="corr" id="xd21e4726" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is perhaps the cry that escaped
the lips of my father,&rdquo; said Elias coldly. &ldquo;Like a
condemned criminal, he fled across mountains and valleys. When he
thought himself far enough away to have lost his identity, he found
work with a rich man of the province of Tayabas. His industry and the
sweetness of his disposition gained him favor. Here he stayed,
economized, got a little capital, and as he was yet young, thought to
be happy. He won the love of a girl of the pueblo, but delayed asking
for her hand, fearing that his past might be uncovered. At length, when
love&rsquo;s indiscretion bore fruit, to save her reputation he was
obliged to risk everything. He asked to marry her, his papers were
demanded, and the truth was learned. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4733" href="#xd21e4733" name="xd21e4733">206</a>]</span>the
father was rich, he instituted a prosecution. The unhappy young man
made no defence, and was sent to the garrison.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium"><span class="corr" id="xd21e4736" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Our mother bore twins, my sister and me.
She died while we were yet young, and we were told that our father was
dead also. As our grandfather was rich, we had a happy childhood; we
were always together, and loved each other as only twins can. I was
sent very early to the college of the Jesuits, and my sister to La
Concordia, that we might not be completely separated. In time we
returned to take possession of our grandfather&rsquo;s property. We had
many servants and rich fields. We were both happy, and my sister was
affianced to a man she adored.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium"><span class="corr" id="xd21e4740" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>By my haughtiness, perhaps, and for
pecuniary reasons, I had won the dislike of a distant relative. He
threw in my face the obscurity of our origin and the dishonor of our
race. Believing it calumny, I demanded satisfaction; the tomb where so
many miseries sleep was opened, and the truth came forth to confound
me. To crown all, there had been with us many years an old servant, who
had suffered all my caprices without complaint. I do not know how our
relative found it out, but he brought the old man before the court and
made him declare the truth: he was our father. Our happiness was ended.
I gave up my inheritance, my sister lost her fianc&eacute;, and with
our father we left the pueblo, to live where he might. The thought of
the unhappiness he had brought upon us shortened our father&rsquo;s
days, and my sister and I were left alone. She could not forget her
lover, and little by little I saw her droop. One day she disappeared,
and I searched everywhere for her in vain. Six months afterward, I
learned that at the time I lost her there had been found on the lake
shore of Calamba the body of a young woman drowned or assassinated. A
knife, they said, was buried in her breast. From what they told
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4743" href="#xd21e4743" name=
"xd21e4743">207</a>]</span>me of her dress and her beauty, I recognized
my sister. Since then I have wandered from province to province, my
reputation and my story following in time. Many things are attributed
to me, often unjustly, but I continue my way and take little account of
men. You have my story, and that of one of the judgments of our
brothers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias rowed on in a silence which was for some time unbroken.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I believe you are not wrong when
you say that justice should interest herself in the education of
criminals,&rdquo; said Cris&oacute;stomo at length; &ldquo;but it is
impossible, it is Utopia; where get the money necessary to create so
many new offices?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why not use the priests, who vaunt
their mission of peace and love? Can it be more meritorious to sprinkle
a child&rsquo;s head with water than to wake, in the darkened
conscience of a criminal, that spark lighted by God in every soul to
guide it in the search for truth? Can it be more humane to accompany a
condemned man to the gallows than to help him in the hard path that
leads from vice to virtue? And the spies, the executioners, the guards,
do not they too cost money?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My friend, if I believed all this,
what could I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Alone, nothing; but if the people
sustained you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall never be the one to lead
the people when they try to obtain by force what the Government does
not think it time to give them. If I should see the people armed, I
should range myself on the side of the Government. I do not recognize
my country in a mob. I desire her good; that is why I build a school. I
seek this good through instruction; without light there is no
route.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Without struggle, no liberty;
without liberty, no light. You say you know your country little. I
believe you. You do not see the conflict coming, the cloud on the
horizon: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4760" href="#xd21e4760"
name="xd21e4760">208</a>]</span>the struggle begun in the sphere of the
mind is going to descend to the arena of blood. Listen to the voice of
God; woe to those who resist it! History shall not be
theirs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias was transfigured. He stood uncovered, his manly face illumined
by the white light of the moon. He shook his mane of hair and
continued:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you not see how everything is
waking? The sleep has lasted centuries, but some day the lightning will
strike, and the bolt, instead of bringing ruin, will bring life. Do you
not see minds in travail with new tendencies, and know that these
tendencies, diverse now, will some day be guided by God into one way?
God has not failed other peoples; He will not fail us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were followed by solemn silence. The boat, drawn on by the
waves, was nearing the bank. Elias was the first to speak.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What shall I say to those who sent
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That they must wait. I pity their
situation, but progress is slow, and there is always much of our own
fault in our misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias said no more. He lowered his eyes and continued to row. When
the boat touched the shore, he took leave of Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I thank you, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;for your kindness to me, and, in your own interest, I
ask you to forget me from this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ibarra was gone, Elias guided his boat toward a clump of reeds
along the shore. His attention seemed absorbed in the thousands of
diamonds that rose with the oar, and fell back and disappeared in the
mystery of the gentle azure waves. When he touched land, a man came out
from among the reeds.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What shall I say to the
captain?&rdquo; he asked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4781"
href="#xd21e4781" name="xd21e4781">209</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell him Elias, if he lives, will
keep his word,&rdquo; replied the helmsman sadly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And when will you join
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When your captain thinks the hour
has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is well; adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I live!&rdquo; repeated Elias,
under his breath. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4792" href=

<p class="first">While Ibarra and Elias were on the lake, old Tasio,
ill in his solitary little house, and Don Filipo, who had come to see
him, were also talking of the country. For several days the old
philosopher, or fool&mdash;as you find him&mdash;prostrated by a
rapidly increasing feebleness, had not left his bed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The country,&rdquo; he was saying
to Don Filipo, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t what it was twenty years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it?&rdquo;
asked the old man, sitting up. &ldquo;Ah! you did not know the past.
Hear the students of to-day talking. New names are spoken under the
arches that once heard only those of Saint Thomas, Suarez, Amat, and
the other idols of my day. In vain the monks cry from the chair against
the demoralization of the times; in vain the convents extend their
ramifications to strangle the new ideas. The roots of a tree may
influence the parasites growing on it, but they are powerless against
the bird, which, from the branches, mounts triumphant toward the
sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man spoke with animation, and his eye shone.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And yet the new germ is very
feeble,&rdquo; said the lieutenant. &ldquo;If they all set about it,
the progress already so dearly paid for may yet be choked.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Choke it? Who? The weak dwarf,
man, to choke progress, the powerful child of time and energy? When
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4812" href="#xd21e4812" name=
"xd21e4812">211</a>]</span>has he done that? He has tried dogma, the
scaffold, and the stake, but <i lang="it">E pur si muove</i> is the
device of progress. Wills are thwarted, individuals sacrificed. What
does that mean to progress? She goes her way, and the blood of those
who fall enriches the soil whence spring her new shoots. The Dominicans
themselves do not escape this law, and they are beginning to imitate
the Jesuits, their irreconcilable enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you hold that the Jesuits move
with progress?&rdquo; asked the astonished Don Filipo. &ldquo;Then why
are they so attacked in Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I reply as did once an
ecclesiastic of old,&rdquo; said the philosopher, laying his head back
on the pillow and putting on his mocking air, &ldquo;that there are
three ways of moving with progress: ahead, beside, behind; the first
guide, the second follow, the third are dragged. The Jesuits are of
these last. At present, in the Philippines, we are about three
centuries behind the van of the general movement. The Jesuits, who in
Europe are the reaction, viewed from here represent progress. For
instance, the Philippines owe to them the introduction of the natural
sciences, the soul of the nineteenth century. As for ourselves, at this
moment we are entering a period of strife: strife between the past
which grapples to itself the tumbling feudal castle, and the future
whose song may be heard afar off, bringing us from distant lands the
tidings of good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man stopped, but seeing the expression of Don Filipo he
smiled and went on.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I can almost divine what you are
thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are thinking that I may easily
be wrong; to-day I have the fever, and I am never infallible. But it is
permitted us to dream. Why not make the dreams agreeable in the last
hours of life? You are right: I do dream! Our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4830" href="#xd21e4830" name=

pleasures; our men of riper years have no activity but in vice, serve
only to corrupt youth with their example; youth spends its best years
without ideal, and childhood wakes to life in rust and darkness. It is
well to die. Claudite jam rivos, pueri.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it time for your
medicine?&rdquo; asked Don Filipo, seeing the cloud on the old
man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The parting have no need of
medicine, but those who stay. In a few days I shall be gone. The
Philippines are in the shadows.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="label">XLIV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">La Gallera.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To keep holy the afternoon of Sunday in Spain, one
goes ordinarily to the plaza de toros; in the Philippines, to the
gallera. Cock-fights, introduced in the country about a century ago,
are to-day one of the vices of the people. The Chinese can more easily
deprive themselves of opium than the Filipinos of this bloody
sport.</p>
<p>The poor, wishing to get money without work, risks here the little
he has; the rich seeks a distraction at the price of whatever loose
coin feasts and masses leave him. The education of their cocks costs
both much pains, often more than that of their sons.</p>
<p>Since the Government permits and almost recommends it, let us take
our part in the sport, sure of meeting friends.</p>
<p>The gallera of San Diego, like most others, is divided into three
courts. In the entry is taken the sa pint&ucirc;, that is, the price of
admission. Of this price the Government has a share, and its revenues
from this source are some hundred thousand pesos a year. It is said
this license fee of vice serves to build schools, open roads, span
rivers, and establish prizes for the encouragement of industry. Blessed
be vice when it produces so happy results! In this entry are found
girls selling buyo, cigars, and cakes. Here gather numerous children,
brought by their fathers or uncles, whose duty it is to initiate them
into the ways of life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4850" href=
"#xd21e4850" name="xd21e4850">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the second court are most of the cocks. Here the contracts are
made, amid recriminations, oaths, and peals of laughter. One caresses
his cock, while another counts the scales on the feet of his, and
extends the wings. See this fellow, rage in his face and heart,
carrying by the legs his cock, deplumed and dead. The animal which for
months has been tended night and day, on which such brilliant hopes
were built, will bring a peseta and make a stew. Sic transit gloria
mundi! The ruined man goes home to his anxious wife and ragged
children. He has lost at once his cock and the price of his industry.
Here the least intelligent discuss the sport; those least given to
thought extend the wings of cocks, feel their muscles, weigh, and
ponder. Some are dressed in elegance, followed and surrounded by the
partisans of their cocks; others, ragged and dirty, the stigma of vice
on their blighted faces, follow anxiously the movements of the rich;
the purse may get empty, the passion remains. Here not a face that is
not animated; in this the Filipino is not indolent, nor apathetic, nor
silent; all is movement, passion. One would say they were all devoured
by a thirst always more and more excited by muddy water.</p>
<p>From this court one passes to the pit, a circle with seats terraced
to the roof, filled during the combats with a mass of men and children;
scarcely ever does a woman risk herself so far. Here it is that destiny
distributes smiles and tears, hunger and joyous feasts.</p>
<p>Entering, we recognize at once the gobernadorcillo, Captain Basilio,
and Jos&eacute;, the man with the scar, so cast down by the death of
his brother. And here comes Captain Tiago, dressed like the sporting
man, in a canton flannel shirt, woollen trousers, and a jipijapa hat.
He is followed by two servants with his cocks. A combat is soon
arranged between one of these and a famous cock of Captain
Basilio&rsquo;s. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4857" href=
"#xd21e4857" name="xd21e4857">215</a>]</span>The news spreads, and a
crowd gathers round, examining, considering, forecasting, betting.</p>
<p>While men were searching their pockets for their last cuarto, or in
lieu of it were engaging their word, promising to sell the carabao, the
next crop, and so forth, two young fellows, brothers apparently, looked
on with envious eyes. Jos&eacute; watched them by stealth, smiling
evilly. Then making the pesos sound in his pocket, he passed the
brothers, looking the other way and crying:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I pay fifty; fifty against twenty
for the l&aacute;sak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers looked at each other discontentedly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I told you not to risk all the
money,&rdquo; said the elder. &ldquo;If you had listened to
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger approached Jos&eacute; and timidly touched his arm.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What! It&rsquo;s you?&rdquo; he
cried, turning and feigning surprise. &ldquo;Does your brother accept
my proposition?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do it. But if you
would lend us something, as you say you know
us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; shook his head, shifted his position, and replied:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, I know you; you are
T&aacute;rsilo and Bruno; and I know that your valiant father died from
the club strokes of these soldiers. I know you don&rsquo;t think of
vengeance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t concern yourself with
our history,&rdquo; said the elder brother, joining them; &ldquo;that
brings misfortune. If we hadn&rsquo;t a sister, we should have been
hanged long ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Hanged! Only cowards are hanged.
Besides, the mountain isn&rsquo;t so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A hundred against fifty for the
b&ucirc;lik!&rdquo; cried some one passing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Loan us four
pesos&mdash;three&mdash;two,&rdquo; begged Bruno. Jos&eacute; again
shook his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sh! the money isn&rsquo;t mine.
Don Cris&oacute;stomo gave it to me for those who are willing to serve
him. But I see you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4889" href=
"#xd21e4889" name="xd21e4889">216</a>]</span>are not like your father;
he was courageous. The man who is not must not expect to divert
himself.&rdquo; And he moved away.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said Bruno,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s talking with Pedro; he&rsquo;s giving him a lot of
money!&rdquo; And in truth Jos&eacute; was counting silver pieces into
the palm of Sisa&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>T&aacute;rsilo was moody and thoughtful; with his shirt sleeve he
wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Bruno,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, if you don&rsquo;t; our father must be
avenged!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said T&aacute;rsilo,
gazing into his eyes&mdash;they were both pale&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going with you. You are right: our father must be avenged!&rdquo; But
he did not move, and again wiped his brow.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo;
demanded Bruno impatiently.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;our
poor sister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah! Isn&rsquo;t Don
Cris&oacute;stomo the chief, and haven&rsquo;t we seen him with the
governor-general? What risk do we run?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if we die?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did not our poor father die under
their clubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers set out to find Jos&eacute;, but hesitation again
possessed T&aacute;rsilo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; come away! we&rsquo;re going
to ruin ourselves!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go on if you want to. I shall
accept!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unhappily a man came up and asked:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you betting? I&rsquo;m for the
l&aacute;sak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; demanded
Bruno.</p>
<p>The man counted his pieces.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have two hundred; fifty against
forty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Bruno resolutely.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4932" href="#xd21e4932" name=
"xd21e4932">217</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Good! Fifty against
thirty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Double it if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A hundred against sixty,
then!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Agreed! Wait while I go for the
money,&rdquo; and turning to his brother he said:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Go away if you want to; I shall
stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>T&aacute;rsilo reflected. He loved Bruno, and he loved sport.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am with you,&rdquo; he said.
They found Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said T&aacute;rsilo,
&ldquo;how much will you give?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you
already; if you will promise to find others to help surprise the
quarters, I&rsquo;ll give you thirty pesos each, and ten to each
companion. If all goes well, they will each receive a hundred, and you
double. Don Cris&oacute;stomo is rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried Bruno;
&ldquo;give us the money!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I knew you were like your father!
Come this way, so that those who killed him cannot hear us,&rdquo; said
Jos&eacute;. And drawing them into a corner, he added as he counted out
the money:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don Cris&oacute;stomo has come and
brought the arms. To-morrow night at eight o&rsquo;clock meet me in the
cemetery. I will give you the final word. Go find your
companions.&rdquo; And he left them.</p>
<p>The brothers appeared to have exchanged r&ocirc;les. T&aacute;rsilo
now seemed undisturbed; Bruno was pale. They went back to the crowd,
which was leaving the circle for the raised seats. Little by little the
place became silent. Only the soltadores were left in the ring holding
two cocks, with exaggerated care, looking out for wounds. The silence
became solemn; the spectators became mere caricatures of men; the fight
was about to begin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4958" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two days later Brother Salvi presented himself at the
house of Captain Tiago. The Franciscan was more gaunt and pale than
usual; but as he went up the steps a strange light shone in his eyes,
and his lips parted in a strange smile. Captain Tiago kissed his hand,
and took his hat and cane, smiling beatifically.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I bring good news,&rdquo; said the
curate as he entered the drawing-room; &ldquo;good news for everybody.
I have letters from Manila confirming the one Se&ntilde;or Ibarra
brought me, so that I believe, Don Santiago, the obstacle is quite
removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara, seated at the piano, made a movement to rise, but her
strength failed her and she had to sit down again. Linares grew pale;
Captain Tiago lowered his eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The young man seems to me very
sympathetic,&rdquo; said the curate. &ldquo;At first I misjudged him.
He is impulsive, but when he commits a fault, he knows so well how to
atone for it that one is forced to forgive him. If it were not for
Father D&aacute;maso&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And the curate flashed a
glance at Maria Clara. She was listening with all her being, but did
not take her eyes off her music, in spite of the pinches that were
expressing Sinang&rsquo;s joy. Had they been alone they would have
danced.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But Father D&aacute;maso has
said,&rdquo; continued the curate, without losing sight of Maria Clara,
&ldquo;that as godfather he could <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e4975" href="#xd21e4975" name="xd21e4975">219</a>]</span>not
permit; but, indeed, I believe if Se&ntilde;or Ibarra will ask his
pardon everything will arrange itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria rose, made an excuse, and with Victorina left the room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if Father D&aacute;maso does
not pardon him?&rdquo; asked Don Santiago in a low voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then Maria Clara must decide. But
I believe the matter can be arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of an arrival was heard, and Ibarra entered. His coming
made a strange impression. Captain Tiago did not know whether to smile
or weep. Father Salvi rose and offered his hand so affectionately that
Cris&oacute;stomo could scarcely repress a look of surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where have you been all
day?&rdquo; demanded wicked Sinang. &ldquo;We asked each other:
&lsquo;What can have taken that soul newly rescued from
perdition?&rsquo; and each of us had her opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And am I to know what each opinion
was?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, not yet! Tell me where you
went, so I can see who made the best guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret too; but I
can tell you by yourself if these gentlemen will permit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Certainly, certainly?&rdquo; said
Father Salvi. Sinang drew Cris&oacute;stomo to the other end of the
great room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell me, little friend,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;is Maria angry with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She says you
had best forget her, and then she cries. This morning when we were
wondering where you were I said to tease her: &lsquo;Perhaps he has
gone a-courting.&rsquo; But she was quite grave, and said: &lsquo;It is
God&rsquo;s will!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tell Maria I must see her
alone,&rdquo; said Ibarra, troubled.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It will be difficult, but
I&rsquo;ll try to manage it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5004" href="#xd21e5004" name="xd21e5004">220</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And when shall I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To-morrow. But you are going
without telling me the secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So I am. Well, I went to the
pueblo of Los Ba&ntilde;os to see about some cocoanut trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a secret!&rdquo; cried Sinang
aloud in a tone of a usurer despoiled.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take care, I really don&rsquo;t
want you to speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no desire to,&rdquo;
said Sinang scornfully. &ldquo;If it had been really of importance I
should have told my friends; but cocoanuts, cocoanuts, who cares about
cocoanuts!&rdquo; and she ran off to find Maria.</p>
<p>Conversation languished, and Ibarra soon took his leave. Captain
Tiago was torn between the bitter and the sweet. Linares said nothing.
Only the curate affected gayety and recounted tales. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The bell was announcing the time of prayer the evening
after. At its sound every one stopped his work and uncovered. The
laborer coming from the fields checked his song; the woman in the
streets crossed herself; the man caressed his cock and said the
Angelus, that chance might favor him. And yet the curate, to the great
scandal of pious old ladies, was running through the street toward the
house of the alf&eacute;rez. He dashed up the steps and knocked
impatiently. The alf&eacute;rez opened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, father, I was just going to
see you; your young buck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something very
important&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the breathless curate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow the fences to
be broken; if he comes back, I shall fire on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who knows whether to-morrow you
will be alive,&rdquo; said the curate, going on toward the
reception-room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What? You think that youngster is
going to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or alf&eacute;rez, the
lives of all of us are in danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate pointed to the door, which the alf&eacute;rez closed in
his customary fashion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now, go ahead,&rdquo; he said
calmly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did you see how I ran? When I thus
forget myself, there is some grave reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And this time it
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5051" href=
"#xd21e5051" name="xd21e5051">222</a>]</span></p>
<p>The curate approached him and spoke low.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you&mdash;know&mdash;of
nothing&mdash;new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Are you speaking of
Elias?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, no! I&rsquo;m speaking of a
great peril!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, finish then!&rdquo; cried
the exasperated alf&eacute;rez.</p>
<p>The curate lowered his voice mysteriously:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have discovered a
conspiracy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez gave a spring and looked at the curate in
stupefaction.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A terrible conspiracy, well
organized, that is to break out to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez rushed across the room, took down his sabre from
the wall, and grasped his revolver.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Whom shall I arrest?&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Be calm! There is plenty of time,
thanks to the haste with which I came. At eight
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They shall be shot, all of
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen! It is a secret of the
confessional, discovered to me by a woman. At eight o&rsquo;clock they
are to surprise the barracks, sack the convent, and assassinate all the
Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez stood dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Be ready for them; ambush your
soldiers; send me four guards for the convent! You will earn your
promotion to-night! I only ask you to make it known that it was I who
warned you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It shall be known, father; it
shall be known, and, perhaps, it will bring down a mitre!&rdquo;
replied the alf&eacute;rez, his eyes on the sleeves of his uniform.</p>
<p>While this conversation was in progress, Elias was running toward
the house of Ibarra. He entered and was shown to the laboratory, where
Cris&oacute;stomo was passing the time until the hour of his
appointment with Maria Clara. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5091"
href="#xd21e5091" name="xd21e5091">223</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! It is you, Elias?&rdquo; he
said, without noticing the tremor of the helmsman. &ldquo;See here!
I&rsquo;ve just made a discovery: this piece of bamboo is
non-combustible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, there is no time to
talk of that; take your papers and flee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked up amazed, and, seeing the gravity of the
helmsman&rsquo;s face, let fall the piece of bamboo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Leave nothing behind that could
compromise you, and may an hour from this time find you in a safer
place than this!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What does all this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That there is a conspiracy on foot
which will be attributed to you. I have this moment been talking with a
man hired to take part in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did he tell you who paid
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He said it was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra stared in stupid amazement.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, you <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e5113" title="Source: havn&rsquo;t">haven&rsquo;t</span>
a moment to lose. The plot is to be carried out to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cris&oacute;stomo still gazed at Elias, as if he did not
understand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I learned of it too late; I
don&rsquo;t know the leaders; I can do nothing. Save yourself,
se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Where can I go? I am due now at
Captain Tiago&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Ibarra, beginning to come out of his
trance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To another pueblo, to Manila,
anywhere! Destroy your papers! Fly, and await events!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And Maria Clara? No! Better
die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias wrung his hands.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Prepare for the accusation, at all
events. Destroy your papers!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Aid me then,&rdquo; said
Cris&oacute;stomo, in almost helpless bewilderment. &ldquo;They are in
these cabinets. My father&rsquo;s letters might compromise me. You will
know them by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5133" href=
"#xd21e5133" name="xd21e5133">224</a>]</span>addresses.&rdquo; And he
tore open one drawer after another. Elias worked to better purpose,
choosing here, rejecting there. Suddenly he stopped, his pupils
dilated; he turned a paper over and over in his hand, then in a
trembling voice he asked:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your family knew Don Pedro
Eibarramendia?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He was my
great-grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your great-grandfather?&rdquo;
repeated Elias, livid.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ibarra
mechanically, and totally unobservant of Elias. &ldquo;The name was too
long; we cut it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Was he a Basque?&rdquo; asked
Elias slowly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes; but what ails you?&rdquo;
said Cris&oacute;stomo, looking round and recoiling before the hard
face and clenched fists of Elias.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know who Don Pedro
Eibarramendia was? Don Pedro Eibarramendia was the wretch who caused
all our misfortune! I have long been searching for his descendants; God
has delivered you into my hands! Look at me! Do you think I have
suffered? And you live, and you love, and have a fortune and a home;
you live, you live!&rdquo; and, beside himself, he ran toward a
collection of arms on the wall. But no sooner had he reached down two
poniards than he dropped them, looking blindly at Ibarra, who stood
rigid.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What was I going to do?&rdquo; he
said under his breath, and he fled like a madman. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Catastrophe.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Captain Tiago, Aunt Isabel, and Linares were dining.
Maria Clara had said she was not hungry, and was at the piano with
Sinang. The two girls had arranged this moment for meeting Ibarra away
from too watchful eyes. The clock struck eight.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming! Listen!&rdquo;
cried the laughing Sinang.</p>
<p>He entered, white and sad. Maria Clara, in alarm, started toward
him, but before any one could speak a fusilade sounded in the street;
then random pistol shots, and cries and clamor. Cris&oacute;stomo
seemed glued to the floor. The diners came running in crying:
&ldquo;The tulisanes! The tulisanes!&rdquo; Aunt Isabel fell on her
knees half dead from fright, Captain Tiago was weeping. Some one rushed
about fastening the windows. The tumult continued outside; then little
by little there fell a dreadful silence. Presently the alf&eacute;rez
was heard crying out as he ran through the street:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Father Salvi! Father
Salvi!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt
Isabel. &ldquo;The alf&eacute;rez is asking for confession!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The alf&eacute;rez is
wounded!&rdquo; murmured Linares, with an expression of the utmost
relief.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The tulisanes have killed the
alf&eacute;rez! Maria, Sinang, into your chamber! Barricade the
door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the protests of Aunt Isabel, Ibarra went out into the
street. Everything seemed turning round and round him; his ears rang;
he could scarcely move his limbs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5174" href="#xd21e5174" name="xd21e5174">226</a>]</span>Spots of
blood, flashes of light and darkness alternated before his eyes. The
streets were deserted, but the barracks were in confusion, and voices
came from the tribunal, that of the alf&eacute;rez dominating all the
others. Ibarra passed unchallenged, and reached his home, where his
servants were anxiously watching for him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Saddle me the best horse and go to
bed,&rdquo; he said to them.</p>
<p>He entered his cabinet and began to pack a valise. He had put in his
money and jewels and Maria&rsquo;s picture and was gathering up his
papers when there came three resounding knocks at the house door.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Open in the name of the King! Open
or we force the door!&rdquo; said an imperious voice. Ibarra armed
himself and looked toward the window; then changed his mind, threw down
his revolver, and went to the door. Three guards immediately seized
him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I make you prisoner in the name of
the King!&rdquo; said the sergeant.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will learn at the tribunal; I
am forbidden to talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am at your disposition. It will
not be for, I suppose, long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If you promise not to try to
escape us, we may leave your hands free; the alf&eacute;rez grants you
that favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cris&oacute;stomo took his hat and followed the guards, leaving his
servants in consternation.</p>
<p>Elias, after leaving the house of Ibarra, ran like a madman, not
knowing whither. He crossed the fields and reached the wood. He was
fleeing from men and their habitations; he was fleeing from light; the
moon made him suffer. He buried himself in the mysterious silence of
the wood. The birds stirred, wakened from their sleep; owls
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5197" href="#xd21e5197" name=
"xd21e5197">227</a>]</span>flew from branch to branch, screeching or
looking at him with great, round eyes. Elias did not see or hear them;
he thought he was followed by the irate shades of his ancestors. From
every branch hung the bleeding head of B&acirc;lat. At the foot of
every tree he stumbled against the cold body of his grandmother; among
the shadows swung the skeleton of his infamous grandfather; and the
skeleton, the body, and the bleeding head cried out: &ldquo;Coward!
Coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran on. He left the mountain and went down to the lake, moving
feverishly along the shore; his wandering eyes became fixed upon a
point on the tranquil surface, and there, surrounded by a silver nimbus
and rocked by the tide, stood a shade which he seemed to recognize.
Yes, that was her hair, so long and beautiful; yes, that was her
breast, gaping from the poniard stroke. And the wretched man, kneeling
in the sand, stretched out his arms to the cherished vision:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Thou! Thou, too!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>His eyes fixed on the apparition, he rose, entered the water and
descended the gentle slope of the beach. Already he was far from the
bank; the waves lapped his waist; but he went on fascinated. The water
reached his breast. Did he know it? Suddenly a volley tore the air; the
night was so calm that the rifle shots sounded clear and sharp. He
stopped, listened, came to himself; the shade vanished; the dream was
gone. He perceived that he was in the lake, level with his eyes across
the tranquil water he saw the lights in the poor cabins of fishermen.
Everything came back to him. He made for the shore and went rapidly
toward the pueblo.</p>
<p>San Diego was deserted; the houses were closed; even the dogs had
hidden themselves. The glittering light that bathed everything detached
the shadows boldly, making the solitude still more dreary. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5208" href="#xd21e5208" name=
"xd21e5208">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>Fearing to encounter the guards, Elias scaled fences and hedges, and
so, making his way through the gardens, reached the home of Ibarra. The
servants were around the door lamenting the arrest of their master.
Elias learned what had happened, and made feint of going away, but
returned to the back of the house, jumped the wall, climbed into a
window and made his way to the laboratory. He saw the papers, the arms
taken down, the bags of money and jewels, Maria&rsquo;s picture, and
had a vision of Ibarra surprised by the soldiers. He meditated a moment
and decided to bury the things of value in the garden. He gathered them
up, went to the window, and saw gleaming in the moonlight the casques
and bayonets of the guard. His plans were quickly laid. He hid about
his person the money and jewels, and, after an instant&rsquo;s
hesitation, the picture of Maria. Then, heaping all the papers in the
middle of the room, he saturated them with oil from a lamp, threw the
lighted candle in the midst, and sprang out of the window. It was none
too soon: the guards were forcing entrance against the protests of the
servants.</p>
<p>But dense smoke made its way through the house and tongues of flame
began to break out. Soldiers and servants together cried fire and
rushed toward the cabinet, but the flames had reached the chemicals,
and their explosion drove every one back. The water the servants could
bring was useless, and the house stood so apart that their cries
brought no aid. The flames leaped upward amid great spirals of smoke;
the house, long respected by the elements, was now their prisoner.

<h2 class="main">Gossip.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was not yet dawn. The street in which were the
barracks and tribunal was still deserted; none of its houses gave a
sign of life. Suddenly the shutter of a window opened with a bang and a
child&rsquo;s head appeared, looking in all directions, the little neck
stretched to its utmost&mdash;plas! It was the sound of a smart slap in
contact with the fresh human skin. The child screwed up his face, shut
his eyes, and disappeared from the window, which was violently closed
again.</p>
<p>But the example had been given: the two bangs of the shutter had
been heard. Another window opened, this time with precaution, and the
wrinkled and toothless head of an old woman looked stealthily out. It
was Sister Put&aacute;, the old dame who had caused such a commotion
during Father D&aacute;maso&rsquo;s sermon. Children and old women are
the representatives of curiosity in the world; the children want to
know, the old women to live over again. The old sister stayed longer
than the child, and gazed into the distance with contracted brows.
Timidly a skylight opened in the house opposite, giving passage to the
head and shoulders of sister Rufa. The two old women looked across at
each other, smiled, exchanged gestures, and signed themselves.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Since the sack of the pueblo by
B&acirc;lat I&rsquo;ve not known such a night!&rdquo; said Sister
Put&aacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a firing! They say it was the
band of old Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Tulisanes? Impossible! I heard it
was the cuadrilleros <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5229" href=
"#xd21e5229" name="xd21e5229">230</a>]</span>against the guards;
that&rsquo;s why Don Filipo was arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They say at least fourteen are
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other windows opened and people were seen exchanging greetings and
gossip.</p>
<p>By the light of the dawn, which promised a splendid day, soldiers
could now be seen dimly at the end of the street, like gray silhouettes
coming and going.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know what it was?&rdquo;
asked a man, with a villainous face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, the cuadrilleros.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or, a
revolt!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What revolt? The curate against
the alf&eacute;rez?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, no; nothing of that kind. It
was an uprising of the Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Chinese!&rdquo; repeated all
the listeners, with great disappointment.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t
see one!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They are all dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&mdash;I suspected they had
something on foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I saw it, too. Last
night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What a pity they are all dead
before Christmas!&rdquo; cried Sister Rufa. &ldquo;We shall not get
their presents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The streets began to show signs of life. First the dogs, pigs, and
chickens began to circulate; then some little ragged boys, keeping hold
of each other&rsquo;s hands, ventured to approach the barracks. Two or
three old women crept after them, their heads wrapt in handkerchiefs
knotted under their chins, pretending to tell their beads, so as not to
be driven back by the soldiers. When it was certain that one might come
and go without risking a pistol shot, the men commenced to stroll out.
Affecting indifference and stroking their cocks, they finally got as
far as the tribunal.</p>
<p>Every quarter hour a new version of the affair was circulated.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5265" href="#xd21e5265" name=
"xd21e5265">231</a>]</span>Ibarra with his servants had tried to carry
off Maria Clara, and in defending her, <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5267" title="Source: Capain">Captain</span> Tiago had been
wounded. The number of dead was no longer fourteen, but thirty. At
half-past seven the version which received most credit was clear and
detailed.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from the
tribunal,&rdquo; said a passer, &ldquo;where I saw Don Filipo and Don
Cris&oacute;stomo prisoners. Well, Bruno, son of the man who was beaten
to death, has confessed everything. You know, Captain Tiago is to marry
his daughter to the young Spaniard. Don Cris&oacute;stomo wanted
revenge, and planned to massacre all the Spaniards. His band attacked
the convent and the barracks. They say many of them escaped. The guards
burned Don Cris&oacute;stomo&rsquo;s house, and if he hadn&rsquo;t been
arrested, they would have burned him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;They burned the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You can still see the smoke from
here,&rdquo; said the narrator.</p>
<p>Everybody looked: a column of smoke was rising against the sky. Then
the comments began, some pitying, some accusing.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Poor young man!&rdquo; cried the
husband of Sister Put&aacute;.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the sister.
&ldquo;You are ready to defend a man that heaven has so plainly
punished? You&rsquo;ll find yourself arrested too. You uphold a falling
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband was silent; the argument had told.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on the old woman.
&ldquo;After striking down Father D&aacute;maso, there was nothing left
but to kill Father Salvi!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t deny he was a
good child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, he was good,&rdquo; replied
the old woman; &ldquo;but he went to Europe, and those who go to Europe
come back heretics, the curates say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said the husband,
taking his advantage. &ldquo;And <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5293" href="#xd21e5293" name="xd21e5293">232</a>]</span>the
curate, and all the curates, and the archbishop, and the pope,
aren&rsquo;t they all Spaniards? What? And are they
heretics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily for Sister Put&aacute;, the conversation was cut short. A
servant came running, pale and horror-stricken.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A man hung&mdash;in our
neighbor&rsquo;s garden!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>A man hung! Nobody stirred.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come and see,&rdquo;
said the old man, rising.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near him,&rdquo;
cried Sister Put&aacute;, &ldquo;&rsquo;twill bring us misfortune. If
he&rsquo;s hung, so much the worse for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let me see him, woman. You, Juan,
go and inform them at the tribunal; he may not be dead.&rdquo; And the
old man went off, the women, even Sister Put&aacute;, following at a
distance, full of fear, but also of curiosity.</p>
<p>Hanging from the branch of a sandal tree in the garden a human body
met their gaze. The brave man examined it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We must wait for the authorities;
he&rsquo;s been dead a long time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Little by little the women drew near.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the new
neighbor,&rdquo; they whispered. &ldquo;See the scar on his
face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In half an hour the authorities arrived.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;People are in a great hurry to
die!&rdquo; said the directorcillo, cocking his pen behind his ear, and
he began his investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a peasant wearing a great salakat on his head and having
his neck muffled was examining the body and the cord. He noticed
several evidences that the man was dead before he was hung. The curious
countryman noticed also that the clothing seemed recently torn and was
covered with dust.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;
demanded the directorcillo, who had gathered all his evidence.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I was looking, se&ntilde;or, to
see if I knew him,&rdquo; stammered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5326" href="#xd21e5326" name="xd21e5326">233</a>]</span>the man,
half uncovering, in which he managed to lower his salakat even farther
over his eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you hear that it
is a certain Jos&eacute;? You must be asleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed. The confused countryman stammered something else
and went away. When he had reached a safe distance, he took off his
disguise and resumed the stature and gait of Elias. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With threatening air the guards marched back and forth
before the door of the town hall, menacing with the butt of their
rifles intrepid small boys, who came and raised themselves on tiptoe to
see through the gratings.</p>
<p>The court room had not the same appearance as the day of the
discussion of the f&ecirc;te. The guards and the cuadrilleros spoke
low; the alf&eacute;rez paced the room, looking angrily at the door
from time to time. In a corner yawned Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, her
steely eyes riveted on the door leading into the prison. The arm-chair
under the picture of His Majesty was empty.</p>
<p>It was almost nine o&rsquo;clock when the curate arrived.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
alf&eacute;rez, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t kept us waiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I did not wish to be here,&rdquo;
said the curate, ignoring the tone of the alf&eacute;rez. &ldquo;I am
very nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I thought it best to wait for
you,&rdquo; said the alf&eacute;rez. &ldquo;We have eight here,&rdquo;
he went on, pointing toward the door of the prison; &ldquo;the one
called Bruno died in the night. Are you ready to examine the two
unknown prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate sat down in the arm-chair.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Let us go on,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bring out the two in the
cepo!&rdquo; ordered the alf&eacute;rez in as terrible a voice as he
could command. Then turning to the curate:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We skipped two holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the benefit of those not acquainted with the instruments
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5361" href="#xd21e5361" name=
"xd21e5361">235</a>]</span>of torture of the Philippines, we will say
that the cepo, a form of stocks, is one of the most innocent; but by
skipping enough holes, the position is made most trying. It is,
however, a torture that can be long endured.</p>
<p>The jailor drew the bolt and opened the door. A sickening odor
escaped, and a match lighted by one of the guards went out in the
vitiated air; when it was possible to take in a candle, one could see
dimly, from the rooms outside, the forms of men crouching or standing.
The cepo was opened.</p>
<p>A dark figure came out between two soldiers; it was T&aacute;rsilo,
the brother of Bruno. His torn clothing let his splendid muscles show.
The other prisoner brought out was weeping and lamenting.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; the
alf&eacute;rez demanded of T&aacute;rsilo.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;T&aacute;rsilo
Alasigan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What did Don Cris&oacute;stomo
promise you for attacking the convent?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have never had any communication
with Don Cris&oacute;stomo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t attempt to deny it:
what other reason had you for joining the conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You had killed our father, we
wished to avenge him, nothing more. Go find two of your guards.
They&rsquo;re at the foot of the precipice, where we threw them. You
may kill me now, you will learn nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence and general surprise.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You will name your
accomplices,&rdquo; cried the alf&eacute;rez, brandishing his cane.</p>
<p>The accused man smiled disdainfully. The alf&eacute;rez talked apart
with the curate.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Take him where the bodies
are,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>In a corner of the patio, on an old cart, five bodies were heaped
under a piece of soiled matting. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5390" href="#xd21e5390" name="xd21e5390">236</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo; asked the
alf&eacute;rez, lifting the covering. T&aacute;rsilo did not reply. He
saw the body of Sisa&rsquo;s husband, and that of his brother, pierced
through with bayonet strokes. His face grew darker, and a great sigh
escaped him; but he was mute.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Beat him till he confesses or
dies!&rdquo; cried the exasperated alf&eacute;rez.</p>
<p>They led him back where the other prisoner, with chattering teeth,
was invoking the saints.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know this man?&rdquo;
demanded Father Salvi.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I never saw him before,&rdquo;
replied T&aacute;rsilo, looking at the poor wretch with faint
compassion.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Fasten him to the bench; gag
him!&rdquo; ordered the alf&eacute;rez, trembling with rage. When this
was done, a guard began his sad task.</p>
<p>Father Salvi, pale and haggard, rose trembling, and left the
tribunal. In the street he saw a girl, leaning against the wall, rigid,
motionless, her eyes far away. The sun shone full down on her. She
seemed not to breathe but to count, one after another, the muffled
blows inside. It was T&aacute;rsilo&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>The torture continued until the soldier, breathless, let his arm
fall, and the alf&eacute;rez ordered his victim released. But
T&aacute;rsilo still refused to speak. Then Do&ntilde;a Consolacion
whispered in her husband&rsquo;s ear; he nodded.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To the well with him!&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The Filipinos know what that means. In Tagalo it is called
timba&icirc;n. We do not know who invented this judiciary process, but
it must belong to antiquity. Truth coming out of a well is perhaps a
sarcastic interpretation.</p>
<p>In the middle of the patio of the tribunal was a picturesque well
curb of uncut stones. It had a rustic crank of bamboo; its water was
slimy and putrid. All sorts of refuse had been thrown around it and in
it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5414" href="#xd21e5414" name=
"xd21e5414">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>Toward this T&aacute;rsilo was led. He was very pale, and his lips
trembled, if he was not praying. The pride he had shown appeared now to
be crushed out; he seemed resigned to suffer. The poor wretch looked
enviously at the pile of bodies, and sighed heavily.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Speak then!&rdquo; said the
directorcillo. &ldquo;You will be hung anyway. Why not die without so
much suffering?&rdquo; But T&aacute;rsilo remained mute.</p>
<p>When the well was reached, they bound his feet. He was to be let
down head foremost. He was fastened to the curb; the crank turned, and
his body disappeared. The alf&eacute;rez noted the seconds with his
watch. At the signal the body was drawn up, too pitiable to describe;
but T&aacute;rsilo was still mute. Again he was let down, again he
refused to speak; when he was drawn up the third time, he no longer

<p>His torturers looked at each other in consternation. The
alf&eacute;rez ordered the body taken down, and they all examined it
for signs of life; but there were none.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said a cuadrillero, at
last, &ldquo;he has strangled himself with his tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Put the body with the
others,&rdquo; ordered the alf&eacute;rez nervously. &ldquo;We must

<p class="first">The news spread that the prisoners were to be taken to
the capital, and members of their families ran wildly from convent to
barracks, from barracks to tribunal, but found no consolation anywhere.
The curate was said to be ill. The guards dealt roughly with the
supplicating women, and the gobernadorcillo was more useless than ever.
The friends of the accused, therefore, had collected near the prison,
waiting for them to be brought out. Doray, Don Filipo&rsquo;s young
wife, wandered back and forth, her child in her arms, both crying. The
Capitana Tinay called on her son Antonio, and brave Capitana Maria
watched the grating behind which were her twins, her only children.</p>
<p>At two in the afternoon, an uncovered cart drawn by two oxen stopped
in front of the tribunal. It was surrounded, and there were loud
threats of breaking it.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; cried
Capitana Maria; &ldquo;do you wish them to go on foot?&rdquo; In a few
moments, twenty soldiers came out and surrounded the ox-cart; then the
prisoners appeared. The first was Don Filipo, who smiled at his wife.
Doray responded by bitter sobs, and would have rushed to her husband,
had not the guards held her back. The son of Capitana Tinay was crying
like a child, which did not help to check the lamentations of his
family. The twins were calm and grave. Ibarra came last. He walked
between two guards, his hand free; his eyes sought on all sides for a
friendly face. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5439" href=
"#xd21e5439" name="xd21e5439">239</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is the guilty one!&rdquo; cried
numerous voices. &ldquo;He is the guilty one, and his hands are
unbound!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bind my arms,&rdquo; said Ibarra
to his guards.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We have no orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bind me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldiers obeyed.</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez appeared on horseback, armed to the teeth, and
followed by an escort of soldiers. The prisoners&rsquo; friends saluted
them with affectionate words; only Ibarra was friendless.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What has my husband done to
you?&rdquo; sobbed Doray. &ldquo;See my child; you have robbed him of
his father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grief began to turn to hate against the man who was said to have
provoked the uprising.</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez gave the order to start.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; cried a woman, as
the cart moved off. &ldquo;While the others fought, you were in hiding!
Coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Curses on you!&rdquo; cried an old
man, running after. &ldquo;Cursed be the gold heaped up by your family
to take away our peace. Accurst! accurst!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May you be hung, heretic!&rdquo;
cried a woman, picking up a stone and throwing it after him. Her
example was promptly followed, and a shower of dust and pebbles beat
against the unhappy man. Cris&oacute;stomo bore this injustice without
a sign. It was the farewell of his beloved country. He bent his head
and sat motionless. Perhaps he was thinking of a man beaten in the
pueblo streets; perhaps of the body of a girl, washed up by the
waves.</p>
<p>The alf&eacute;rez felt obliged to drive away the crowd, but stones
did not cease to fall, nor insult to sound. One mother only did not
curse Ibarra; the Capitana Maria watched her sons go, with compressed
lips and eyes full of silent tears.</p>
<p>Of all the people in the open windows as he passed, none
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5469" href="#xd21e5469" name=
"xd21e5469">240</a>]</span>but the indifferent and curious showed
Ibarra the least compassion. All his friends had deserted him, even
Captain Basilio, who had forbidden Sinang to weep. When
Cris&oacute;stomo passed the smoking ruins of his home, that home where
he was born, and spent his happy childhood and youth, the tears, long
repressed, gushed from his eyes, and bound as he was, he had to
experience the bitterness of showing a grief that could not rouse the
slightest sympathy.</p>
<p>From a hill, an old man, pale and thin, wrapped in a mantle, and
leaning on a stick, watched the sad procession. At the news of what had
happened, old Tasio had left his bed, and tried to go to the pueblo,
but his strength had failed him. He followed the cart with his eyes,
until it disappeared in the distance. Then, after resting a while in
thought, he got up painfully, and started toward his home, halting for
breath at almost every step. The next day some shepherds found him dead
under the shadow of his solitary house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">The telegraph had secretly transmitted to Manila the
news of the uprising, and thirty-six hours later, the newspapers, their
accounts expanded, corrected, and mutilated by the attorney-general,
talked about it with much mystery and no little menace. Meanwhile the
private accounts, coming out of the convents, had gone from mouth to
mouth, to the great alarm of those who heard them. The fact, distorted
in countless versions, was accepted as true with more or less
readiness, according to its fitness to the passions and ideas of the
different hearers.</p>
<p>Though public tranquillity was not disturbed, the peace of the
hearthstones became like that of a fish-pond, all on top; underneath
was commotion. Crosses, gold lace, office, power, honors of all kinds
began to hover over one part of the population, like butterflies in a
golden sunshine. For the others a dark cloud rose on the horizon, and
against this ashy background stood in relief bars, chains, and the
fateful arms of the gibbet. Destiny presented the event to the Manila
imagination, like certain Chinese fans: one face painted black, the
other gilded, and gorgeous with birds and flowers.</p>
<p>There was great agitation in the convents. The provincials ordered
their carriages, and held secret conferences; then presented themselves
at the palace, to offer their support to the imperiled government.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A Te Deum, a Te Deum!&rdquo; said
a monk in one convent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5487" href=

goodness of God, our worth is made manifest in these perilous
times!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;This petty general, this prophet
of evil, will gnaw his moustaches after this little lesson,&rdquo; said
another.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What would have become of him
without the religious orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The papers almost go to the point
of demanding a mitre for Brother Salvi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And he will get it! He&rsquo;s
consumed with desire for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be? In
these days mitres are given for the asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If mitres had eyes, and could see
on what craniums&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We spare our readers other comments of this nature. Let us enter the
home of a private citizen, and as we know few people at Manila, we will
knock at the door of Captain Tinong, the friendly and hospitable
gentleman whom we saw inviting Ibarra, with so much insistence, to
honor his house with a visit.</p>
<p>In his rich and spacious drawing-room, at Tondo, Captain Tinong is
seated in a great arm-chair, passing his hand despairingly across his
brow; while his weeping wife, the Capitana Tinchang, reads him a
sermon, listened to by their two daughters, who are seated in a corner,
mute with stupefaction.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, Virgin of Antipolo!&rdquo;
cried the wife. &ldquo;Ah, Virgin of the Rosary; I told you so! I told
you so! Ah, Virgin of Carmel! Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why, no! You didn&rsquo;t tell me
anything,&rdquo; Captain Tinong finally ventured to reply. &ldquo;On
the contrary, you said I did well to keep up the friendship with
Captain Tiago, and to go to his house, because&mdash;because he was
rich; and you said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5512" href="#xd21e5512" name="xd21e5512">243</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What did I say? I didn&rsquo;t say
it! I didn&rsquo;t say anything! Ah, if you had listened to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Now you throw the blame back on
me!&rdquo; said the captain bitterly, striking the arm of his chair
with his fist. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say I did well to invite him to
dinner, because, as he was rich&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is true I said that,
because&mdash;because it couldn&rsquo;t be helped; you had already
invited him; and you did nothing but praise him. Don Ibarra here, and
Don Ibarra there, and Don Ibarra on all sides. But I didn&rsquo;t
advise you to see him or to speak to him at the dinner. That you cannot
deny!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Did I know, for instance, that he
was to be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You ought to have known
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;How, if I wasn&rsquo;t even
acquainted with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You ought to have been acquainted
with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, Tinchang, if it was the first
time I had ever seen him or heard him spoken of?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You ought to have seen him before,
you ought to have heard him spoken of; that&rsquo;s what you are a man
for! And now, you will be sent into exile, our goods will be
confiscated&mdash;&mdash;Oh, if I were a man! if I were a
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And if you were a man,&rdquo;
asked the vexed husband, &ldquo;what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What? Why, to-day, this very day,
I should present myself to the captain-general, and offer to fight
against the rebels, this very day!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you read what the
Diario says? Listen! &lsquo;The infamous and abortive treason has been
repressed with energy, force, and vigor, and the rebellious enemies of
the country and their accomplices will promptly feel all the weight and
all the severity of the laws!&rsquo; You see, there is no
rebellion!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That makes no difference, you
should present yourself; many did it in 1872, and so nobody harmed
them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5540" href="#xd21e5540"
name="xd21e5540">244</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes! it was done also by Father
Bug&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But his wife&rsquo;s hands were over his
mouth.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Say it! Speak that name, so you
may be hung to-morrow at Bagumbayan! Don&rsquo;t you know it is enough
to get you executed without so much as a trial? Go on, say
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though Captain Tinong had wished, he couldn&rsquo;t have done
it. His wife held his mouth with both her hands, squeezing his little
head against the back of the chair. Perhaps the poor man would have
died of asphyxia, had not a new person come on the stage.</p>
<p>It was their cousin, Don Primitivo, who knew Amat by heart; a man of
forty, large and corpulent, and dressed with the utmost care.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Quid video?&rdquo; he cried, upon
entering; &ldquo;what is going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah, cousin!&rdquo; said the wife,
weeping, and running to him, &ldquo;I had you sent for, for I
don&rsquo;t know what will become of us! What do you advise&mdash;you
who have studied Latin and understand
reasoning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But <span lang="la">quid
qu&aelig;ritis? Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in
sensu</span>.&rdquo; And he sat down sedately. The Latin phrases seemed
to have a tranquillizing effect; the husband and wife ceased to lament,
and came nearer, awaiting the counsel of their cousin&rsquo;s lips, as
once the Greeks awaited the saving phrase of the oracle.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why are you mourning? <span lang=
"la">Ubinam gentium sumus?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You know the story of the
uprising&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, what of it? Don
Cris&oacute;stomo owes you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No! but do you know that Tinong
invited him to dinner, and that he bowed to him on the
bridge&mdash;&mdash;in the middle of the day? They will say he was a
friend of ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Friend?&rdquo; cried the Latin, in
alarm, rising; &ldquo;tell me who your friends are, and I&rsquo;ll tell
you who you are yourself! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5572"
href="#xd21e5572" name="xd21e5572">245</a>]</span><span lang="la">Malum
est negotium et est timendum rerum istarum horrendissimum resultatum.
Hum!</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>So many words in um terrified Captain Tinong. He became frightfully
pale. His wife joined her hands in supplication.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cousin, you speak to us now in
Latin, but you know we haven&rsquo;t studied philosophy like you. Speak
to us in Tagal or Castilian; give us your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is deplorable that you do not
know Latin, my cousin: Latin verities are lies in Tagalo. <span lang=
"la">Contra principi negantem fustibus est arguendum</span>, is, in
Latin, a truth as veritable as Noah&rsquo;s ark. I once put it in
practice in Tagalo, and it was I who got beaten. It is indeed a
misfortune that you do not know Latin! In Latin it might all be
arranged. You have done wrong, very wrong, cousins, to make friends
with this young man. The just pay the dues of sinners. I feel almost
like advising you to make your will!&rdquo; and he moved his head
gloomily from side to side.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Saturnino, what ails you?&rdquo;
cried Capitana Tinchang, terrified. &ldquo;Ah! Heaven! he is dead! A
doctor! Tinong, Tinongy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He has only fainted, cousin; bring
some water.&rdquo; Don Primitivo sprinkled his face, and the
unfortunate man revived.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Come, come! don&rsquo;t weep!
I&rsquo;ve found a remedy. Put him in bed. Come, come! courage! I am
with you, and all the wisdom of the ancients! Call a doctor, and this
very day, cousin, go present yourself to the captain-general, and take
him a present, a gold chain, a ring; say it&rsquo;s a Christmas
present. Shut the windows and doors, and if any one asks for your
husband, say he is seriously ill. Meanwhile I&rsquo;ll burn all the
letters, papers, and books, as Don Cris&oacute;stomo did. Scripti
testes sunt! Go on to the captain&rsquo;s. Leave me to myself. In
extremis extrema. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5592" href=
"#xd21e5592" name="xd21e5592">246</a>]</span>Give me the power of a
Roman dictator, and see whether I save the coun&mdash;What am I
saying&mdash;the cousin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He commenced to upset the shelves of the library, and tear papers
and letters. Then he lighted a fire on the kitchen hearth, and the
<i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i> began. &ldquo;&lsquo;Revolutions of the
Celestial Spheres,&rsquo; by Copernicus. Whew! <span lang="la">ite,
maledicte, in ignem kalanis!</span>&rdquo; he cried, throwing it to the
flames. &ldquo;Revolution and Copernicus! Crime upon crime! If I
don&rsquo;t get through soon enough! &lsquo;Liberty in the
Philippines!&rsquo; What books! Into the fire with them!&rdquo; The
most innocent works did not escape the common fate. Cousin Primitivo
was right. The just pay for sinners.</p>
<p>Four or five hours later, at a fashionable gathering, the events of
the day were being discussed. There were present a number of elderly
married ladies and spinsters, together with the wives and daughters of
clerks of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e5604" title=
"Source: adminstration">administration</span>, all in European costume,
fanning and yawning. Among the men, who, by their manners, showed their
position, as did the women, was a man advanced in age, small and
one-armed, who was treated with distinction, and who kept a reserved
distance.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I could never before suffer the
monks and civil guards, because of their want of manners,&rdquo; a
portly lady was saying, &ldquo;but now that I see of what service they
are, I could almost marry one of them. I am patriotic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am of the very same mind,&rdquo;
said a very prim spinster. &ldquo;But what a pity the former governor
isn&rsquo;t with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He would put an end to the race of
filibusterillos!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they say there are
many islands yet uninhabited?<span class="corr" id="xd21e5615" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If I were the
captain-general&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e5623"
title="Source: Senoras">Se&ntilde;oras</span>,&rdquo; said the
one-armed man, &ldquo;the captain-general knows his duty. I understand
he is greatly irritated, for he had loaded this Ibarra with
favors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Loaded him with favors!&rdquo;
repeated the slim gentlewoman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5628"
href="#xd21e5628" name="xd21e5628">247</a>]</span>fanning furiously.
&ldquo;What ingrates these Indians are! Is it possible to treat them
like human beings?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;ve
heard?&rdquo; asked an officer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No! What is it? What do they
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;People worthy of confidence say
that all this noise about building a school was a pure pretext; what he
meant to make was a fort for his own defence when he had been
attacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What infamy! Would any one but an
Indian be capable of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But they say this filibustero is
the son of a Spaniard,&rdquo; said the one-armed man, without looking
at anybody.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There it is again,&rdquo; cried
the portly lady; &ldquo;always these creoles! No Indian understands
anything about revolution. Train crows, and they&rsquo;ll pick your
eyes out!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;ve
heard?&rdquo; asked a pretty creole, to turn the conversation.
&ldquo;The wife of Captain Tinong&mdash;you remember? We danced and
dined at his house at the f&ecirc;te of Tondo&mdash;well, the wife of
Captain Tinong gave the captain-general, this afternoon, a ring worth a
thousand pesos. She said it was a Christmas present.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Christmas doesn&rsquo;t come for a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She must have feared a
downpour,&rdquo; said the stout lady.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And so got under cover,&rdquo;
said the slim.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is evident,&rdquo; said the
one-armed man, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I fear there is something back of
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I also,&rdquo; said the portly
lady. &ldquo;The wife of Captain Tinong is very parsimonious&mdash;she
has never sent us presents, though we have been to her house. When such
a person lets slip a little present of a thousand little
pesos&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But is it certain?&rdquo; demanded
the one-armed man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Absolutely! His excellency&rsquo;s
aide-de-camp told my cousin, to whom he is engaged. I&rsquo;m tempted
to believe it&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5659" href=
"#xd21e5659" name="xd21e5659">248</a>]</span>a ring she wore the day of
the f&ecirc;te. She&rsquo;s always covered with diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one way of
advertising! Instead of buying a lay-figure or renting a
shop&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The one-armed man found a pretext for leaving.</p>
<p>Two hours later, when all the city was asleep, certain inhabitants
of Tondo received an invitation through the medium of soldiers.
Authority could not permit people of position and property to sleep in
houses so ill guarded. In the fortress of Santiago, and in other
government buildings, their sleep would be more tranquil and
refreshing. Among these people was the unfortunate Captain Tinong.

<p class="first">Captain Tiago was very happy. During these troublous
times, no one had paid any attention to him. He had not been arrested,
he had not been subjected to cross-examination, to electrical machines,
to repeated foot-baths in subterranean habitations, nor to any other of
these pleasantries, well known to certain people who call themselves
civilized. His friends, that is to say, those who had been&mdash;for he
had repudiated his Filipino friends as soon as they had become suspects
in the eyes of the Government&mdash;had returned home after several
days of vacation in the edifices of the State. The captain-general had
ordered them out of his possessions, to the great displeasure of the
one-armed man, who would have liked to celebrate the approaching
Christmas in so numerous a company of the rich.</p>
<p>Captain Tinong returned to his home, ill, pale, another man. The
excursion had not been for his good. He said nothing, not even to greet
his family, who laughed and wept over him, mad with joy. The poor man
no longer left the house, for fear of saluting a filibuster. Cousin
Primitivo himself, with all the wisdom of the ancients, could not draw
him out of his mutism.</p>
<p>Stories like that of Captain Tinong&rsquo;s were numerous, and
Captain Tiago was not ignorant of them. He overflowed with gratitude,
without knowing exactly to whom he owed these signal favors. Aunt
Isabel attributed the miracle to the Virgin of Antipolo. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5679" href="#xd21e5679" name=
"xd21e5679">250</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I too, Isabel,&rdquo; said Captain
Tiago, &ldquo;but the Virgin of Antipolo has probably not done it
alone; my friends have helped, and my future son-in-law, Se&ntilde;or
Linares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was whispered that Ibarra would be hung; that in spite of lack of
proofs of his guilt, one thing had been found that confirmed the
accusation; the experts had declared the school was so designed that it
might pass for a rampart, faulty enough, to be sure, but what one might
expect of ignorant Indians.</p>
<p>In the midst of affairs, Do&ntilde;a Victorina, Don Tiburcio, and
Linares arrived. As usual, Do&ntilde;a Victorina talked for the three
men and herself; and her speech had undergone a remarkable change. She
now claimed to have naturalized herself an Andalusian by suppressing
d&rsquo;s and replacing the sound of s by that of z. No one had been
able to get the idea out of her head; one would certainly have needed
to get her frizzes off the outside first. She talked of visits of
Linares to the captain-general, and made continual insinuations as to
advantages a relative of position would bring.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;As we say,&rdquo; she concluded,
&ldquo;he who sleeps in a good shade, leans on a good staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
opposite, wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria Clara was yet pale, though she had almost recovered from her
illness. She kissed Do&ntilde;a Victorina, smiling rather sadly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have been saved, thanks to
your connections!&rdquo; said the doctora, with a significant look
toward Linares.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;God has protected my
father,&rdquo; said Maria, in a low voice.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, Clarita, but the time of
miracles is past. We, the Spaniards say, trust not in the Virgin, and
save yourself by running.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;the contrary, wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We must talk business,&rdquo; said
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, glancing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5703" href="#xd21e5703" name="xd21e5703">251</a>]</span>at Maria.
Maria found a pretext for leaving, and went out, steadying herself by
the furniture.</p>
<p>What was said in this conference was so sordid and mean, that we
prefer not to report it. Suffice it to say that when they parted, they
were all satisfied. Captain Tiago said a little after to Aunt
Isabel:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Have the caterer notified that we
give a reception to-morrow. Maria must get ready for her marriage at
once. When Se&ntilde;or Linares is our son-in-law, all the palaces will
be open to us; and every one will die of envy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, toward eight o&rsquo;clock the next evening, the house of
Captain Tiago was once more full. This time, however, he had invited
only Spaniards, peninsular and Philippine, and Chinese. Yet many of our
acquaintances were there. Father Sibyla and Father Salvi, among
numerous Franciscans and Dominicans; the old lieutenant of the
Municipal Guard, more sombre than ever; the alf&eacute;rez, recounting
his victory for the thousandth time, looking over the heads of
everybody, now that he is lieutenant with grade of commandant; Dr.
Espada&ntilde;a, who looks upon him with respect and fear, and avoids
his glance; Do&ntilde;a Victorina, who cannot see him without anger.
Linares had not yet arrived; as a person of importance, he must arouse
expectation. There are beings so simple, that an hour&rsquo;s waiting
for a man suffices to make him great in their eyes.</p>
<p>Maria Clara was the object of interest to all the women, and the
subject of unveiled comments. She had received these ceremoniously,
without losing her air of sadness.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bah! the proud little
thing!&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Rather pretty,&rdquo; said
another, &ldquo;but he might have chosen some one with a more
intelligent face.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But the money, my dear! The good
fellow is selling himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another group some one was saying: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5722" href="#xd21e5722" name="xd21e5722">252</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To marry when one&rsquo;s first
fianc&eacute; is going to be hung!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;That is what is called prudent;
having a substitute at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, when one becomes a
widow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly some of these remarks reached the ears of Maria Clara. She
grew paler, her hand trembled, her lips seemed to move.</p>
<p>In the circles of men the talk was loud, and naturally the recent
events were the subject of conversation. Everybody talked, even Don
Tiburcio.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I hear that your reverence is
about to leave the pueblo,&rdquo; said the new lieutenant, whom his new
star had made more amiable.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have no more to do there; I am
to be placed permanently at Manila. And you?&rdquo; asked Father
Salvi.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I also leave the pueblo,&rdquo;
said he, throwing back his shoulders; &ldquo;I am going with a flying
column to rid the province of filibusters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Salvi surveyed his old enemy from top to toe, and turned away
with a disdainful smile.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Is it known certainly what is to
be done with the chief filibuster?&rdquo; asked a clerk.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are speaking of Don
Cris&oacute;stomo Ibarra,&rdquo; replied another. &ldquo;It is very
probable that he will be hung, like those of 1872, and it will be very
just.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He is to be exiled,&rdquo; said
the old lieutenant dryly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Exile! Nothing but exile?&rdquo;
cried numerous voices at once. &ldquo;Then it must be for
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If the young man had been more
prudent,&rdquo; went on Lieutenant Guevara, speaking so that all might
hear, &ldquo;if he had confided less in certain persons to whom he
wrote, if our attorney-generals did not interpret too subtly what they
read, it is certain he would have been released.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This declaration of the old lieutenant&rsquo;s, and the tone of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5754" href="#xd21e5754" name=
"xd21e5754">253</a>]</span>his voice, produced a great surprise among
his auditors. No one knew what to say. Father Salvi looked away,
perhaps to avoid the dark look the lieutenant gave him. Maria Clara
dropped some flowers she had in her hand, and became a statue. Father
Sibyla, who knew when to be silent, seemed the only one who knew how to
question.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You speak of letters, Se&ntilde;or
Guevara.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I speak of what I am told by Don
Cris&oacute;stomo&rsquo;s advocate, who is greatly interested in his
case, and defended him with zeal. Outside of a few ambiguous lines in a
letter addressed to a woman before he left for Europe, in which the
procurator found a project against the Government, and which the young
man acknowledged as his, there was no evidence against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And the declaration made by the
tulisan before he died?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The defence destroyed that
testimony. According to the witness himself, none of them had any
communication with Ibarra, except one named Jos&eacute;, who was his
enemy, as was proven, and who afterward committed suicide, probably
from remorse. It was shown that the papers found on his body were
forgeries, for the writing was like Ibarra&rsquo;s seven years ago, but
not like his hand of to-day. For this it was supposed that the accusing
letter served as a model.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You tell us,&rdquo; said a
Franciscan, &ldquo;that Ibarra addressed this letter to a woman. How
did it come into the hands of the attorney-general?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant did not reply. He looked a moment at Father Salvi,
and moved off, twisting the point of his gray beard. The others
continued to discuss the matter.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Even women seem to have hated
him,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He burned his house, thinking to
save himself, but he counted without his hostess!&rdquo; said another,
laughing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the old soldier approached Maria Clara. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5775" href="#xd21e5775" name=
"xd21e5775">254</a>]</span>had heard the whole conversation, sitting
motionless, the flowers lying at her feet.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are a prudent young
woman,&rdquo; he said in a low voice; &ldquo;by giving over the letter,
you assured yourself a peaceful future.&rdquo; And he moved on, leaving
Maria with blank eyes and a face rigid. Fortunately Aunt Isabel passed.
Maria had strength to take her by the dress.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; cried
the old lady, terrified at the face of her niece. &ldquo;You are ill,
my child. You are ready to faint. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My heart&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
crowd&mdash;so much light&mdash;I must rest. Tell my father I&rsquo;ve
gone to rest,&rdquo; and steadying herself by her aunt&rsquo;s arm, she
went to her room.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are cold! Do you want some
tea?&rdquo; asked Aunt Isabel at the door.</p>
<p>Maria shook her head. &ldquo;Go back, dear aunt, I only need to
rest,&rdquo; she said. She locked the door of her little room, and at
the end of her strength, threw herself down before a statue,
sobbing:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother, mother, my
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moonlight came in through the window, and through the door
leading to the balcony. The joyous music of the dance, peals of
laughter and the hum of conversation, made their way to the chamber.
Many times they knocked at her door&mdash;her father, her aunt,
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, even Linares. Maria did not move or speak; now
and then a hoarse sob escaped her.</p>
<p>Hours passed. After the feast had come the ball. Maria&rsquo;s
candle had burned out, and she lay in the moonlight at the foot of the
statue. She had not moved. Little by little the house became quiet.
Aunt Isabel came to knock once again at the door.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She must have gone to bed,&rdquo;
the old lady called back to her brother. &ldquo;At her age one sleeps
like the dead.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5796" href=
"#xd21e5796" name="xd21e5796">255</a>]</span></p>
<p>When all was still again, Maria rose slowly, and looked out on the
terrace with its vines bathed in the white moonlight.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A peaceful future!&mdash;Sleep
like the dead!&rdquo; she said aloud; and she went out.</p>
<p>The city was mute; only now and then a carriage could be heard
crossing the wooden bridge. The girl raised her eyes toward the sky;
then slowly she took off her rings, the pendants in her ears, the comb
and jewelled pins in her hair, and put them on the balustrade of the
terrace; then she looked toward the river.</p>
<p>A little bark, loaded with zacate, drew up to the landing-place
below the terrace. One of the two men in it climbed the stone steps,
sprang over the wall, and in a moment was mounting the stairway of the
terrace. At sight of Maria, he stopped, then approached slowly.</p>
<p>Maria drew back.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cris&oacute;stomo!&rdquo; she
said, speaking low. She was terrified.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes, I am
Cris&oacute;stomo,&rdquo; replied the young man gravely. &ldquo;An
enemy, a man who has reason to hate me, Elias, has rescued me from the
prison where my friends put me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sad silence followed his words. Maria Clara bent her head. Ibarra
went on:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;By the dead body of my mother, I
pledged myself, whatever my future, to try to make you happy. I have
risked all that remains to me, to come and fulfil that promise. Chance
lets me speak to you, Maria; we shall never see each other again. You
are young now; some day your conscience may upbraid you. Before I go
away forever, I have come to say that I forgive you. Be
happy&mdash;farewell!&rdquo; And he began to move away; she held him
back.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Cris&oacute;stomo!&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;God has sent you to save me from despair. Listen and judge
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra tried gently to release himself. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5820" href="#xd21e5820" name=
"xd21e5820">256</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I did not come to call you to
account; I came to bring you peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I want none of the peace you bring
me. I shall find peace for myself. You scorn me and your scorn will
make even death bitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw despair in her poor, young face, and asked what she
wished.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I wish you to believe that I have
always loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Ah! you doubt me! you doubt your
childhood&rsquo;s friend, who has never hidden a single thought from
you! When you know my history, the sad story that was told me in my
illness, you will pity me; you will no longer wear that smile. Why did
they not let me die in the hands of my ignorant doctor! You and I
should both have been happier!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped a moment, then went on:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You force me to this, by your
doubts; may my mother forgive me! In one of the most painful of my
nights of suffering, a man revealed to me the name of my real father.
If he had not been my father, this man said, he might have pardoned the
injury you had done him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cris&oacute;stomo looked at Maria in amazement.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What was I to do?&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;Ought I to sacrifice to my love the memory of my mother, the
honor of him who was supposed to be my father, and the good name of him
who is? And could I have done this without bringing dishonor upon you
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But the proof&mdash;have you had
proof? There must be proof!&rdquo; said Cris&oacute;stomo,
staggered.</p>
<p>Maria drew from her breast two papers.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Here are two letters of my
mother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;written in her remorse. Take
them! Read them! My father left them in the house where he lived so
many years. This man found them and kept them, and only gave them up to
me in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5848" href="#xd21e5848" name=
"xd21e5848">257</a>]</span>exchange for your letter, as assurance, he
said, that I would not marry you without my father&rsquo;s consent. I
sacrificed my love! Who would not for a mother dead and two fathers
living? Could I foresee what use they would make of your letter? Could
I know I was sacrificing you too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra was speechless. Maria went on:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What remained for me to do? Could
I tell you who my father was? Could I bid you ask his pardon, when he
had so made your father suffer? Could I say to my father, who perhaps
would have pardoned you&mdash;could I say I was his daughter? Nothing
remained but to suffer, to guard my secret, and die suffering! Now, my
friend, now that you know the sad story of your poor Maria, have you
still for her that disdainful smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria, you are a saint!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am blessed, because you believe
in me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said
Cris&oacute;stomo, remembering, &ldquo;I heard you were to
marry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sobbed the poor child,
&ldquo;my father demands this sacrifice; he has loved me, nourished me,
and it did not belong to him to do it. I shall pay him my debt of
gratitude by assuring him peace through this new connection,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall not forget my vows to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is your thought?&rdquo; asked
Ibarra, trying to read in her clear eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The future is obscure. I do not
know what I shall do; but I know this, that I can love but once, and
that I shall not belong to one I do not love. And you? What will you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am no longer anything but a
fugitive&mdash;I shall fly, and my flight will soon be overtaken,
Maria&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria took his head in her hands, kissed his lips again and again,
then pushed him away with all her strength. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5875" href="#xd21e5875" name=
"xd21e5875">258</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Fly, fly!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibarra looked at her with shining eyes, but she made a sign, and he
went, reeling for an instant like a drunken man. He leaped the wall
again, and was back in the little bark. Maria Clara, leaning on the
balustrade, watched till it disappeared in the distance. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Chase on the Lake.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen, se&ntilde;or, to the
plan I have made,&rdquo; said Elias, as he pulled toward San Gabriel.
&ldquo;I will hide you, for the present, at the house of a friend of
mine at Mandaluyong. I will bring you there your gold, that I hid in
the tomb of your great-grandfather. You will leave the
country&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To live among strangers?&rdquo;
interrupted Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;To live in peace. You have friends
in Spain; you may get amnesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cris&oacute;stomo did not reply; he reflected in silence.</p>
<p>They arrived at the Pasig, and the little bark began to go up
stream. On the bridge was a horseman, hastening his course, and a
whistle long and shrill was heard.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; said Ibarra at
length, &ldquo;your misfortunes are due to my family, and you have
twice saved my life. I owe you both gratitude and restitution of
property. You advise me to leave the country; well, come with me. We
will live as brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias shook his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is true that I can never be
happy in my country, but I can live and die there, perhaps die for my
country. That is always something. But you can do nothing for her, here
and now. Perhaps some day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Unless I, too, should become a
tulisan,&rdquo; mused Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, a month ago we sat
in this same boat, under the light of this same moon. You could not
have said such a thing then.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e5907" href="#xd21e5907" name="xd21e5907">260</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, Elias. Man seems to be an
animal who varies with circumstances. I was blind then, unreasonable, I
know not what. Now the bandage has been torn from my eyes; the
wretchedness and solitude of my prison has taught me better. I see the
cancer that is eating into our society; perhaps, after all, it must be
torn out by violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came in sight of the governor-general&rsquo;s palace, and
thought they saw unusual movement among the guards.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Your escape must have been
discovered,&rdquo; said Elias. &ldquo;Lie down, se&ntilde;or, so I can
cover you with the zacate, for the sentinel at the magazine may stop
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Elias had anticipated, the sentinel challenged him, and asked him
where he came from.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;From Manila, with zacate for the
iodores and curates,&rdquo; said he, imitating the accent of the people
of Pandakan.</p>
<p>A sergeant came out.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sulung,&rdquo; said he to Elias,
&ldquo;I warn you not to take any one into your boat. A prisoner has
just escaped. If you capture him and bring him to me, I will give you a
fine reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Good, se&ntilde;or; what is his
description?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;He wears a long coat, and speaks
Spanish. Look out for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bark moved off. Elias turned and saw the sentinel still standing
by the bank.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We shall lose a few
minutes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we shall have to go into the rio Beata,
to make him think I&rsquo;m from Pe&ntilde;a Francia. You shall see the
rio of which Francisco Baltazar sang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pueblo was asleep in the moonlight. Cris&oacute;stomo sat up to
admire the death-like peace of nature. The rio was narrow, and its
banks were plains strewn with zacate. Elias discharged his cargo, and
from the grass where they were hidden, drew some of those sacks of palm
leaves that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5933" href="#xd21e5933"
name="xd21e5933">261</a>]</span>are called bayones. Then they pushed
off again, and soon were back on the Pasig. From time to time they
talked of indifferent things.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Santa Ana!&rdquo; said Ibarra,
speaking low; &ldquo;do you know that building?&rdquo; They were
passing the country house of the Jesuits.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent many happy days
there,&rdquo; said Elias. &ldquo;When I was a child, we came here every
month. Then I was like other people; had a family, a fortune; dreamed,
thought I saw a future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent until they came to Malapad-na-bat&ocirc;. Those who
have sometimes cut a wake in the Pasig, on one of these magnificent
nights of the Philippines, when from the limpid azure the moon pours
out a poetic melancholy, when shadows hide the miseries of men and
silence puts out their sordid words&mdash;those who have done this will
know some of the thoughts of these two young men.</p>
<p>At Malapad-na-bat&ocirc;, the rifleman was sleepy, and seeing no
hope of plunder in the little bark, according to the tradition of his
corps and the habit of this post, he let it pass. The guard at Pasig
was no more disquieting.</p>
<p>The moonlight was growing pale, and dawn was beginning to tint the
east with roses, when they arrived at the lake, smooth and placid as a
great mirror. At a distance they saw a gray mass, advancing little by
little.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
fal&uacute;a,&rdquo; said Elias under his breath. &ldquo;Lie down,
se&ntilde;or, and I will cover you with these bags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outlines of the government boat grew more and more distinct.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s getting between us and
the shore,&rdquo; said Elias, uneasily; and very gradually he changed
the direction of his bark. To his terror he saw the fal&uacute;a make
the same change, and heard a voice hailing him. He stopped and thought.
The shore was yet some distance away; they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5951" href="#xd21e5951" name=
"xd21e5951">262</a>]</span>would soon be within range of the
ship&rsquo;s guns. He thought he would go back to Pasig, his boat could
escape the other in that direction; but fate was against him. Another
boat was coming from Pasig, and in it glittered the helmets and
bayonets of the Civil Guards.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;We are caught!&rdquo; he said, and
the color left his face. He looked at his sturdy arms, and took the
only resolution possible; he began to row with all his might toward the
island of Talim. The sun was coming up. The bark shot rapidly over the
water; on the fal&uacute;a, which changed its tack, Elias saw men
signalling.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you know how to manage a
bark?&rdquo; he demanded of Ibarra.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Because we are lost unless I take
to the water to throw them off the track. They will pursue me. I swim
and dive well. That will turn them away from you, and you must try to
save yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No, stay, and let us sell our
lives dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;It is useless; we have no arms;
they would shoot us down like birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, they heard a hiss in the water, followed by a
report.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; said Elias, laying
down his oar. &ldquo;We will meet, Christmas night, at the tomb of your
grandfather. Save yourself! God has drawn me out of greater perils than
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took off his shirt; a ball picked it out of his hands, and two
reports followed. Without showing alarm, he grasped the hand Ibarra
stretched up from the bottom of the boat, then stood upright and leaped
into the water, pushing off the little craft with his foot.</p>
<p>Outcries were heard from the fal&uacute;a. Promptly, and at some
distance, appeared the head of the young man, returning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e5974" href="#xd21e5974" name=
"xd21e5974">263</a>]</span>to the surface to breathe, then disappearing
immediately.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;There, there he is,&rdquo; cried
several voices, and balls whistled.</p>
<p>The fal&uacute;a and the bark from Pasig set out in pursuit of the
swimmer. A slight wake showed his direction, more and more removed from
Ibarra&rsquo;s little bark, which drifted as if abandoned. Every time
Elias raised his head to breathe, the guards and the men of the
fal&uacute;a fired on him.</p>
<p>The chase went on. The little bark with Ibarra was left far behind.
Elias was not more than a hundred yards from the shore. The rowers were
getting tired, but so was Elias, for he repeatedly raised his head
above the water, but always in a new direction, to disconcert his
pursuers. The deceiving wake no longer told the place of the swimmer.
For the last time they saw him, sixty feet from the shore. The soldiers
fired&mdash;minutes and minutes passed. Nothing again disturbed the
tranquil surface of the lake.</p>
<p>A half hour later, one of the rowers claimed to have seen traces of
blood near the shore, but his comrades shook their heads in doubt.

<p class="first">In vain the precious wedding presents heaped up; not
the brilliants in their velvet cases, not embroideries of pi&ntilde;a
nor pieces of silk, drew the eyes of Maria Clara. She saw nothing but
the journal in which was told the death of Ibarra, drowned in the
lake.</p>
<p>Suddenly she felt two hands over her eyes, clasping her head, while
a merry voice said to her:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Who is it? Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria sprang up in fright.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Little goose! Did I scare you, eh?
You weren&rsquo;t expecting me, eh? Why, I&rsquo;ve come from the
province to be at your marriage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And with a
satisfied smile, Father D&aacute;maso gave her his hand to kiss. She
took it, trembling, and carried it respectfully to her lips.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What is it, Maria?&rdquo; demanded
the Franciscan, troubled, and losing his gay smile. &ldquo;Your hand is
cold, you are pale&mdash;are you ill, little girl?&rdquo; And he drew
her tenderly to him, took both her hands and questioned her with his
eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you confide in your
godfather?&rdquo; he asked in a tone of reproach. &ldquo;Come, sit down
here and tell me your griefs, as you used to do when you were little,
and wanted some tapers to make wax dolls. You know I&rsquo;ve always
loved you&mdash;never scolded you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and his voice
became very tender. Maria began to cry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e6005" href="#xd21e6005" name="xd21e6005">265</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Why do you cry, my child? Have you
quarrelled with Linares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria put her hands over her eyes.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s not about
him&mdash;now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso looked startled. &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t
tell me your secrets? Have I not always tried to satisfy your slightest
wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria raised to him her eyes full of tears, looked at him a moment,
then sobbed afresh.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria came slowly to him, fell on her knees at his feet, and raising
her face wet with tears, asked in a voice scarcely audible:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Do you still love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Child!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then&mdash;protect my father and
make him break off my marriage.&rdquo; And she told him of her last
interview with Ibarra, omitting everything about the secret of her
birth.</p>
<p>Father D&aacute;maso could scarcely believe what he heard. She was
talking calmly now, without tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;So long as he lived,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;I could struggle, I could hope, I had confidence; I
wished to live to hear about him; but now&mdash;that they have killed
him, I have no longer any reason to live and suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">
&ldquo;And&mdash;Linares&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;If he had lived, I might have
married&mdash;for my father&rsquo;s sake; but now that he is dead, I
want the convent&mdash;or the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You loved him so?&rdquo; stammered
Father D&aacute;maso. Maria did not reply. The father bent his head on
his breast.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he said at last
in a broken voice, &ldquo;forgive me for having made you <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e6040" title="Source: unhapppy">unhappy</span>; I did
not know I was doing it! I thought of your future. How could I let you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6043" href="#xd21e6043" name=
"xd21e6043">266</a>]</span>marry a man of this country, to see you,
later on, an unhappy wife and mother? I set myself with all my strength
to get this love out of your mind, I used all means&mdash;for you, only
for you. If you had been his wife, you would have wept for the
unfortunate position of your husband, exposed to all sorts of dangers,
and without defence; a mother, you would have wept for your children;
had you educated them, you would have prepared them a sad future; they
would have become enemies of religion; the gallows or exile would have
been their portion; had you left them in ignorance, you would have seen
them tyrannized over and degraded. I could not consent to this. That is
why I found for you a husband whose children should command, not obey;
punish, not suffer&mdash;I knew your childhood&rsquo;s friend was good,
and I liked him, as I did his father; but I hated them both for your
sake, because I love you as one loves a daughter, because I idolize
you&mdash;I have no other love; I have seen you grow up, there
isn&rsquo;t an hour in which I do not think of you, you are my one
joy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And Father D&aacute;maso began to cry like a
child.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then if you love me, do not make
me forever miserable; he is dead, I wish to be a nun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man rested his forehead in his hand.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;A nun, a nun!&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;You do not know, my child, all that is hidden behind the walls
of a convent, you do not know! I would a thousand times rather see you
unhappy in the world than in the cloister. Here your complaints can be
heard; there you have only the walls! You are beautiful, very
beautiful; you were not made to renounce the world. Believe me, my
child, time alters all things; later you will forget, you will love,
you will love your husband&mdash;Linares.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Either the convent
or&mdash;death,&rdquo; repeated Maria, with no sign of yielding.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6053" href="#xd21e6053" name=
"xd21e6053">267</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; said the father,
&ldquo;I am not young. I cannot watch over you always; choose something
else, find another love, another husband, anything, what you
will!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I choose the convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;My God, my God!&rdquo; cried the
priest, burying his face in his hands. &ldquo;You punish me, be it so!
But watch over my daughter!&mdash;Maria, you shall be a nun. I cannot
have you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maria took his hands, pressed them, kissed them as she knelt.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Godfather, my godfather,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; cried the heart of
the father, &ldquo;thou dost exist, because thou dost chastise! Take
vengeance upon me, but do not strike the innocent; save my
daughter!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6067" href=

<h2 class="label">LV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Nochebuena.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Up on the side of the mountain, where a torrent
springs, a cabin hides under the trees, <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6075" title="Source: builded">built</span> on their gnarled
trunks. Over its thatched roof creep the branches of the gourd, heavy
with fruit and flowers. Antlers and wild boars&rsquo; heads, some of
them bearing their long tusks, ornament the rustic hearth. It is the
home of a Tagalo family living from the chase and the cup of the
woods.</p>
<p>Under the shade of a tree, the grandfather is making brooms from the
veins of palm leaves, while a girl fills a basket with eggs, lemons,
and vegetables. Two children, a boy and a girl, are playing beside
another boy, pale and serious, with great, deep eyes. We know him. It
is Sisa&rsquo;s son, Basilio.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;When your foot is well,&rdquo;
said the little boy, &ldquo;you will go with us to the top of the
mountain and drink deer&rsquo;s blood and lemon juice; then
you&rsquo;ll grow fat; then I&rsquo;ll show you how to jump from one
rock to another, over the torrent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basilio smiled sadly, examined the wound in his foot, and looked at
the sun, which was shining splendidly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sell these brooms, Lucia,&rdquo;
said the grandfather to the young girl, &ldquo;and buy something for
your brothers. To-day is Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Fire-crackers, I want
fire-crackers!&rdquo; cried the little boy.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;And what do you want?&rdquo; the
grandfather asked Basilio. The boy got up and went to the old man.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;have I been ill more than a month?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6092" href="#xd21e6092" name=
"xd21e6092">269</a>]</span></p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Since we found you, faint and
covered with wounds, two moons have passed. We thought you were going
to die&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;May God reward you; we are very
poor,&rdquo; said Basilio; &ldquo;but as to-day is Christmas, I want to
go to the pueblo to see my mother and my little brother. They must have
been looking everywhere for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;But, son, you aren&rsquo;t well
yet, and it is far to your pueblo. You would not get there till
midnight. My sons will want to see you when they come from the
forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You have many children, but my
mother has only us two; perhaps she thinks me dead already. I want to
give her a present to-night&mdash;a son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grandfather felt his eyes grow dim.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are as sensible as an old man!
Go, find your mother, give her her present! Go, my son. God and the
Lord Jesus go with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What, you&rsquo;re not going to
stay and see my fire-crackers?&rdquo; said the little boy.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I want you to play hide and
seek!&rdquo; pouted the little girl; &ldquo;nothing else is so much
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basilio smiled and his eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I shall come back soon,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and bring my little brother; then you can play with him.
But I must go away now with Lucia.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget us!&rdquo; said
the old man, &ldquo;and come back when you are well.&rdquo; The
children all accompanied him to the bridge of bamboo over the rushing
torrent. Lucia, who was going to the first pueblo with her basket, made
him lean on her arm; the other children watched them both out of
sight.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The north wind was blowing, and the dwellers in San Diego were
trembling with cold. It was the Nochebuena, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6120" href="#xd21e6120" name=
"xd21e6120">270</a>]</span>and yet the pueblo was sad. Not a paper
lantern hung in the windows, no noise in the houses announcing the
joyful time, as in other years.</p>
<p>At the home of Captain Basilio, the master of the house is talking
with Don Filipo; the troubles of these times have made them
friends.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are in rare luck, to be
released at just this moment,&rdquo; Captain Basilio was saying to his
guest. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve burned your books, that&rsquo;s true; but
others have fared worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman came up to the window and looked in. Her eyes were
brilliant, her face haggard, her hair loose; the moon made her
uncanny.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Sisa?&rdquo; asked Don Filipo, in
surprise. &ldquo;I thought she was with a physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Basilio smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The doctor feared he might be
taken for a friend of Don Cris&oacute;stomo&rsquo;s, so he drove her
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What else has happened since I
went away? I know we have a new curate and a new
alf&eacute;rez&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Well, the head sacristan was found
dead, hung in the garret of his house. And old Tasio is dead. They
buried him in the Chinese cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Poor Don Astasio!&rdquo; sighed
Don Filipo. &ldquo;And his books?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The devout thought it would be
pleasing to God if they should burn them; nothing escaped, not even the
works of Cicero. The gobernadorcillo was no check
whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were both silent. At that moment, the melancholy song of Sisa
was heard. A child passed, limping, and running toward the place from
which the song came; it was Basilio. The little fellow had found his
home deserted and in ruins. He had been told about his mother; of
Crispin he had not heard a word. He had dried his tears, smothered his
grief, and without resting, started out to find Sisa. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6145" href="#xd21e6145" name=
"xd21e6145">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>She had come to the house of the new alf&eacute;rez. As usual, a
sentinel was pacing up and down. When she saw the soldier, she took to
flight, and ran as only a wild thing can. Basilio saw her, and fearing
to lose sight of her, forgot his wounded foot, and followed in hot
pursuit. Dogs barked, geese cackled, windows opened here and there, to
give passage to the heads of the curious; others banged to, from fear
of a new night of trouble. At this rate, the runners were soon outside
the pueblo, and Sisa began to moderate her speed. There was a long
distance between her and her pursuer.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he cried, when he
could distinguish her.</p>
<p>No sooner did Sisa hear the voice than she again began to run
madly.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s I,&rdquo; cried
the child in despair. Sisa paid no attention. The poor little fellow
followed breathless. They were now on the border of the wood.</p>
<p>Bushes, thorny twigs, and the roots of trees hindered their
progress. The child followed the vision of his mother, made clear now
and then by the moon&rsquo;s rays across the heavy foliage. They were
in the mysterious wood of the family of Ibarra. Basilio often stumbled
and fell, but he got up again, without feeling his hurts, or
remembering his lameness. All his life was concentrated in his eyes,
which never lost the beloved figure from view.</p>
<p>They crossed the brook, which was singing gently, and to his great
surprise, Basilio saw his mother press through the thicket and enter
the wooden door that closed the tomb of the old Spaniard. He tried to
follow her, but the door was fast. Sisa was defending the
entrance&mdash;holding the door closed with all her strength.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s I, it&rsquo;s
I, Basilio, your son!&rdquo; cried the child, falling from fatigue. But
Sisa would not budge. Her feet braced against the ground, she offered
an energetic resistance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6161" href=
"#xd21e6161" name="xd21e6161">272</a>]</span>Basilio examined the wall,
but could not scale it. Then he made the tour of the grave. He saw a
branch of the great tree, crossed by a branch of another. He began to
climb, and his filial love did miracles. He went from branch to branch,
and came over the tomb at last.</p>
<p>The noise he made in the branches startled Sisa. She turned and
would have fled, but her son, letting himself drop from the tree,
seized her in his arms and covered her with kisses; then, worn out, he
fainted away.</p>
<p>Sisa saw his forehead bathed in blood. She bent over him, and her
eyes, almost out of their sockets, were fixed on his face, which
stirred the sleeping cells of her brain. Then something like a spark
flashed through them. Sisa recognized her son, and with a cry fell on
his senseless body, pressing it to her heart, kissing him and weeping.
Then mother and son were both motionless.</p>
<p>When Basilio came to himself, he found his mother without
consciousness. He called her, lavished tender names on her, and seeing
she did not wake, ran for water and sprinkled her pale face. But the
eyes remained closed. In terror, Basilio put his ear to her heart, but
her heart no longer beat. The poor child embraced the dead body of his
mother, weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>On this night of joy for so many children, who, by the warm hearth,
celebrate the feast which recalls the first loving look Heaven gave to
earth; on this night when all good Christian families eat, laugh, and
dance, &rsquo;mid love and kisses; on this night which, for the
children of cold countries, is magical with its Christmas trees,
Basilio sits in solitude and grief. Who knows? Perhaps around the
hearth of the silent Father Salvi are children playing; perhaps they
are singing:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Christmas comes,</p>
<p class="line">And Christmas goes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e6177" href="#xd21e6177" name=
"xd21e6177">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>The child was sobbing. When he raised his head, a man was looking
silently down at him.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You are her son?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Basilio nodded his head.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;What are you going to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Bury her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;In the cemetery?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I have no money&mdash;if you would
help me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I am too weak,&rdquo; said the
man, sinking gradually to the ground. &ldquo;I am wounded. For two days
I have not eaten or slept. Has no one been here to-night?&rdquo; And
the man sat still, watching the child&rsquo;s attractive face.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said he, in a voice
growing feebler, &ldquo;I too shall be dead before morning. Twenty
paces from here, beyond the spring, is a pile of wood; put our two
bodies on it, and light the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basilio listened.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;Then, if nobody comes, you are to
dig here; you will find a lot of gold, and it will be all yours.
Study!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the unknown man sank lower and lower. Then he turned
his head toward the east, and said softly, as though praying:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;I die without seeing the light of
dawn on my country. You who shall see it and greet it, do not forget
those who fell in the night!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Miss Gertrude Hall is known to the world as a poet and as a teller
of tales, but with her first novel she reveals new gifts, for it is a
modern story tuned to a note of light comedy that she has never struck
before. &ldquo;April&rsquo;s Sowing&rdquo; is that most widely

<p>Two Unknown Phases of Life Made Known in Fiction</p>
<p><b>The Powers That Prey</b></p>
<p>By <span class="sc">Josiah Flynt</span> and <span class="sc">Francis
Walton</span></p>
<p>The authors of the ten closely related stories which make up this
volume have spent most of their lives studying the sociological
problems of tramp and criminal life. Mr. Flynt writes: &ldquo;So far as
I am concerned, the book is the result of ten years of wandering with
tramps and two years spent with various police organizations.&rdquo;
The stories are a decided contribution to sociology, and yet, viewed as
stories, they have unusual interest because of their remarkable vigor
and their intense realism.</p>

<p>The Soul of the Street</p>
<p>By NORMAN DUNCAN</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The Soul of the Street&rdquo; has
a unity lacking in many volumes of short stories. They deal with
Syrians and Turks, queer folk with queer ways, and Mr. Duncan has
gotten at them with such sympathetic insight as only the poetic heart
and the story-teller&rsquo;s eye can possess. Character, humor,
poignant pathos, and the sad grotesque conjunctions of old and new
civilizations are expressed through the medium of a style that has
distinction, and strikes a note of rare personality.</p>
