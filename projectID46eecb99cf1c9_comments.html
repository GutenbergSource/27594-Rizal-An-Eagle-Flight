This is the first (abbreviated) English translation of José Rizal's novel Nole me Tangere, originally written in Spanish. José Rizal is the Philippine national hero.

<p>Another translation is already in PG as etext <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6737">6737</a>. Having two different translations available is worthwhile. This translation is the only one Americans coming to the Philippines prior to 1912 had access to. At least three other translations to English have been produced, but these are still copyrighted. Also in project Gutenberg are a Tagalog and Dutch translation. A French translation is also in preparation.</BODY></HTML>
